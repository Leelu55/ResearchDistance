<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Laoshankou Fe-Cu-Au deposit is located at the northern margin of Junggar Terrane, Xinjiang, China. This deposit is hosted in Middle Devonian andesitic volcanic breccias, basalts, and conglomerate-bearing basaltic volcanic breccias of the Beitashan Formation. Veined and lenticular Fe-Cu-Au orebodies are spatially and temporally related to diorite porphyries in the ore district. Wall-rock alteration is dominated by skarn (epidote, chlorite, garnet, diopside, actinolite, and tremolite), with K-feldspar, carbonate, albite, sericite, and minor quartz. On the basis of field evidence and petrographic observations, three stages of mineralization can be distinguished: (1) a prograde skarn stage; (2) a retrograde stage associated with the development of Fe mineralization; and (3) a quartz-sulfide-carbonate stage associated with Cu-Au mineralization. Electron microprobe analysis shows that garnets and pyroxenes are andradite and diopside-dominated, respectively. Fluid inclusions in garnet yield homogenization temperatures (T-h) of 205-588 degrees C, and salinities of 8.95-17.96 wt.% NaCl equiv. In comparison, fluid inclusions in epidote and calcite yield T-h of 212-498 and 150-380 degrees C, and salinities of 7.02-27.04 and 13.4-18.47 wt.% NaCl equiv., respectively. Garnets yield values of 6.4% to 8.9% delta O-18(fluid), whereas calcites yield values of -2.4%. and 4.2% delta O-18(fluid), and -0.9% to 2.4% delta C-13(PDB), indicating that the ore-forming fluids were dominantly magmatic fluids in the early stage and meteoric water in the late stage. The delta S-34 values of sulfides range from -2.6% to 5.4%, indicating that the sulfur in the deposit was probably derived from deep-seated magmas. The diorite porphyry yields LA-MC-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb age of 379.7 +/- 3.0 Ma, whereas molybdenites give Re-Os weighted mean age of 383.2 +/- 4.5 Ma (MSWD = 0.06). These ages suggest that the mineralization-related diorite porphyry was emplaced during the Late Devonian, coincident with the timing of mineralization within the Laoshankou Fe-Cu-Au deposit. The geological and geochemical evidence presented here suggest that the Laoshankou Fe-Cu-Au deposit is a skarn deposit. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This paper contributes to the understanding of the genesis of epigenetic, hypogene BIF-hosted iron deposits situated in the eastern part of Ukrainian Shield. It presents new data from the Krivoy Rog iron mining district (Skelevatske-Magnetitove deposit, Frunze underground mine and Balka Severnaya Krasnaya outcrop) and focuses on the investigation of ore genesis through application of fluid inclusion petrography, micro-thermometry, Raman spectroscopy and baro-acoustic decrepitation of fluid inclusions. The study investigates inclusions preserved in quartz and magnetite associated with the low-grade iron ores (31-37% Fe) and iron-rich quartzites (38-45% Fe) of the Saksaganskaya Suite, as well as magnetite from the locally named high-grade iron ores (52-56% Fe). These high-grade ores resulted from alteration of iron quartzites in the Saksaganskiy thrust footwall (Saksaganskiy tectonic block) and were a precursor to supergene martite, high-grade ores (60-70% Fe). Based on the new data two stages of iron ore formation (metamorphic and metasomatic) are proposed. The metamorphic stage, resulting in formation of quartz veins within the low-grade iron ore and iron-rich quartzites, involved fluids of four different compositions: CO2-rich, H2O, H2O-CO2(+/- N-2-CH4)-NaCl(+/- NaHCO3) and H2O-CO2(+/- N-2-CH4)-NaCl. The salinities of these fluids were relatively low (up to 7 mass% NaCl equiv.) as these fluids were derived from dehydration and decarbonation of the BIF rocks, however the origin of the nahcolite (NaHCO3) remains unresolved. The minimum P-T conditions for the formation of these veins, inferred from microthermometry are T-min = 219-246 degrees C and P-min = 130-158 MPa. The baro-acoustic decrepitation analyses of magnetite bands indicated that the low-grade iron ore from the Skelevatske-Magnetitove deposit was metamorphosed at T = similar to 530 degrees C. The metasomatic stage post-dated and partially overlapped the metamorphic stage and led to the upgrade of iron quartzites to the high-grade iron ores. The genesis of these ores, which are located in the Saksaganskiy tectonic block (Saksaganskiy ore field), and the factors controlling iron ore-forming processes are highly controversial. According to the study of quartz-hosted fluid inclusions from the thrust zone the metasomatic stage involved at least three different episodes of the fluid flow, simultaneous with thrusting and deformation. During the 1st episode three types of fluids were introduced: CO2-CH4-N-2(+/- C), CO2(+/- N-2-CH4) and low salinity H2O-N-2-CH4-NaCl (6.38-7.1 mass% NaCl equiv.). The 2nd episode included expulsion of the aqueous fluids H2O-N2CH4-NaCl(+/- CO2, +/- C) of moderate salinities (15.22-16.76 mass% NaCl equiv.), whereas the 3rd event involved high salinity fluids H2O-NaCl(+/- C) (20-35 mass% NaCl equiv.). The fluids most probably interacted with country rocks (e.g. schists) supplying them with CH4 and N-2. The high salinity fluids were most likely either magmatic-hydrothermal fluids derived from the Saksaganskiy igneous body or heated basinal brines, and they may have caused pervasive leaching of Fe from metavolcanic and/or the BIF rocks.
   <br>The baro-acoustic decrepitation analyses of magnetite comprising the high-grade iron ore showed formation T = similar to 430-500 degrees C. The fluid inclusion data suggest that the upgrade to high-grade Fe ores might be a result of the Krivoy Rog BIF alteration by multiple flows of structurally controlled, metamorphic and magmatic-hydrothermal fluids or heated basinal brines.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Sarcheshmeh area is located in the Kerman Cu metallogenic province (KCMP) in the southeastern part of the Uramia-Dokhtar magmatic arc in Iran. The Sarcheshmeh contains numerous Cu deposits making it ideal for the study on the structural controls in the magmatic arc. The study area is cut by major (first-order) and minor (second-order) faults, and contains different types of Cu occurrences, which have been here studied using geoinformation techniques (GiT), which consist of remote sensing techniques, GIS analyses and careful field investigations. The outcome of this study has confirmed that the Cu mineralization in KCMP is structurally controlled in faults. On a regional scale, the major faults (together with their second-order splays) form a braided fault pattern containing predominantly SE-trending faults. On a local scale, the main faults together with their splays form a rhombohedral pattern, which is due to a transtensional deformation related to the formation of pull-apart basins along the KCMP. This tectonic regime prepared the suitable environment for the ascent and final emplacement of felsic plutons in a broad linear zone trending SE. The Cu mineralization and accompanying alteration zones are hosted by the second-order faults. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Trans-North China Orogen (TNCO), a Paleoproterozoic suture that amalgamates the Western and Eastern Blocks of the North China Craton (NCC), witnessed extensive magmatism and metallogeny during Mesozoic, associated with intraplate tectonics and differential destruction of the cratonic lithosphere. Here we investigate a suite of porphyry dykes surrounding the Mapeng batholith in the Fuping Complex within the TNCO in relation to the Mesozoic gold and molybdenum mineralization. The major element chemistry of these dykes show a range of SiO2 (57.92 to 69.47 wt.%), Na2O (3.20 to 4.77 wt.%), K2O (3.12 to 4.60 wt.%) and MgO (0.51 to 3.67 wt.%), together with high concentration of LREE and LILE, and relatively low contents of HREE and HFSE. The rocks display (La/Yb)(N) = 13.53-48.11, negative Nb, Ta, Th, U and Zr anomalies, and distinctly positive Ba, K and Sm anomalies. The mineralogy and geochemistry of the porphyry dykes indicate the rocks to be high-K calc-alkaline, and I-type, with adakitic features similar to those of the adjacent Mapeng batholith. The source magma for these rocks was derived from a mixture of reworked ancient continent crust and juvenile mantle materials. The zircon U-Pb data from these rocks show ages in the range of 124 to 129 Ma, broadly coinciding with the emplacement age of the Mapeng intrusion. The inherited zircons of ca. 2.5, 2.0 and 1.8 Gain the dykes represent capture from the basement rocks during melting. The zircon Lu-Hf isotopic compositions show negative epsilon(Hf)(t) values varying from -27.8 to -11.3, with Hf depleted model ages (t(DM)) ranging from 1228 Ma to 1918 Ma and Hf crustal model ages (t(DM)(C)) of 1905 Ma to 2938 Ma, suggesting that the Mesozoic magmatism and associated metallogeny involved substantial recycling of ancient basement rocks of the NCC. We present an integrated model to evaluate the genesis of the porphyry systems and their relation to mineralization. We envisage that these dykes probably acted as stoppers (impermeable barriers) that prevented the leakage and run-off of the ore-bearing fluids, and played a key role in concentrating the gold and molybdenum mineralization.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Taldybulak Levoberezhny gold deposit, located in the eastern part of the Kyrgyz Northern Tien Shan, is hosted in highly deformed Precambrian schist and gneisses that have undergone intense quartz, carbonate, fuchsite and tourmaline alterations. Gold mineralization is ultimately subdivided into two stages based on the observation of alteration assemblages, orebody geometries, and the occurrences of Au-bearing minerals. Negative thermal ionization mass spectrometry Re-Os isotopic analyses of five Au-rich pyrite samples from the early stage yielded an isochron age of 511 +/- 18 Ma. Zircon sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe U-Pb dating of a diorite dike sample postdating the late stage mineralization yielded a wide range of ages from 3055 to 291 Ma, while a weighted mean Pb-206/U-238 age of 414.6 +/- 6.8 Ma is believed to represent the age of dike intrusion and the upper limit on the timing of the late stage quartz-tourmaline-gold formation. The pyrite (OS)-O-187/(OS(initial))-O-188 ratio of 0.132 +/- 0.011, together with gamma(OS) values varying from 0 to +14, indicate a major mantle component for the source of Os and by inference ore metals, which may be linked to the ophiolite suite of the Kopurelisai Complex in the Taldybulak Levoberezhny area. Considering the geodynamic setting of the Kyrgyz Northern Tien Shan during the early Paleozoic, we suggest that Cambrian mineralization of the Taldybulak Levoberezhny deposit can be attributed to a subduction-related setting, probably associated with the earliest accretion of the Northern Tien Shan.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The giant Dexing porphyry copper deposit is one of the largest porphyry copper deposits in South China. This paper presents new LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating, element and Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic data for the ore-related porphyries in the Dexing porphyry deposit The Dexing ore-related porphyries were emplaced during the Middle Jurassic (ca. 170 Ma), and were characterized by high-Mg adakitic geochemical features, including high MgO and Sr contents and high Mg#, Sr/Y and La-N/Yb-N ratios, low Y and Yb contents, and lacking a negative Eu anomaly, which suggest that they were probably derived from the delaminated thickened lithosphere. A non-arc setting in the Middle Jurassic is indicated by the absence of arc rocks and the presence of rifting-related igneous rock associations in the interior of South China. The non-arc setting suggests that the copper-rich lithosphere in the Dexing area was enriched by an ancient subduction event prior to the Late Mesozoic. The regional geological history and the Neoproterozoic two-stage Nd-Hf isotope model ages imply that the ancient subduction event occurred in the Neoproterozoic in response to the Jiangnan Orogen between the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks. Thus, we infer that the giant Dexing porphyry copper deposit was formed in the Middle Jurassic by remelting of the copper-rich Neoproterozoic subduction-modified lithosphere. Previous studies of the low-Mg ore-related porphyries in the adjacent Yinshan copper polymetallic deposit proposed a copper-rich juvenile crust as their magma source. In this study, the high Mg contents of the Dexing ore-related porphyries stress the significant contribution of the subduction-modified lithospheric mantle or a higher melting temperature.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Cihai iron skarn deposit is located in the southern part of the eastern Tianshan, Xinjiang, northwestern China. The major iron orebodies are banded and nearly parallel to each other. The iron ores are hosted in an early diabase dike and in skarn. Post-ore diabase dikes cut the iron ores and their hosting diabase. Hydrothermal activity can be divided into four stages based on geological and petrographic observations: initial K-Na alteration (stage I), skarn-minor magnetite event (II), retrograde skarn-magnetite main ore event (III), and quartzcalcite-sulfide veining (IV). Zircon U-Pb dating yields ages of 286.5 +/- 1.8 Ma for early diabase and 275.8 +/- 2.2 Ma for post-ore diabase dikes. Amphibole separated from massive magnetite ore gives a Ar-40-Ar-39 plateau age of 281.9 +/- 2.2 Ma and is the time of ore formation. Formation of the Cihai iron deposit is closely related to post-collisional magmatism and associated Cu-Ni-Au polymetallic mineralization in the eastern Tianshan. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The mantle section of Al'Ays ophiolite consists of heterogeneously depleted harzburgites, dunites and large-sized chromitite pods. Two chromitite-bearing sites (Site1 and Site2), about 10 km apart horizontally from one another, were examined for their upper mantle rocks. Cr-spinels from the two sites have different chemistry; Cr-rich in Site1 and Al-rich in Site2. The average Cr-ratio = (Cr/(Cr + Al) atomic ratio) of Cr-spinels in harzburgites, dunites and chromitites is remarkably high 0.78, 0.77 and 0.87, respectively, in Site1, compared with those of Site2 which have intermediate ratio averages 0.5, 0.56 and 0.6, respectively. The platinum-group elements (PGE) in chromitites also show contrasting patterns from Site1 to Site2; having elevated IPGE (Os, Ir, Ru) and strongly depleted in PPGE (Rh, Pt, Pd) with steep negative slopes in the former, and gentle negative slopes in the latter. The oxygen fugacity (Delta logfO(2)) values deduced from harzburgites and dunites of Site1 show a wide variation under reducing conditions, mostly below the FMQ buffer. The Site2 harzburgites and dunites, on the other hand are mostly above the FMQ buffer. Two magmatic stages are suggested for the lithospheric evolution of Al'Ays ophiolite in response to a switch of tectonic setting. The first stage produced a peridotites-chromitites suite with Al-rich Cr-spinels, possibly beneath a mid-ocean ridge setting, or most likely in back-arc rift of a supra-subduction zone setting. The second stage involved higher degrees of partial melting, produced a peridotiteschromitites suite with Cr-rich Cr-spinels, possibly in a fore-arc setting. The coexistence of compositionally different mantle suites with different melting histories in a restricted area of an ophiolite complex may be attributable to a mechanically juxtaposed by mantle convection during recycling. The mantle harzburgites and dunites are apt to be compositionally modified during recycling process; being highly depleted (Site1 case) than their original composition (Site2 case).

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In this contribution we discuss a series of porphyry and porphyry-skarn mineral systems, which constitute important metallogenic belts along major lithospheric breaks and/or collision zones that form the margins of the North China craton and the Yangtze craton. We describe a selection of porphyry and porphyry-skarn deposits in the Great Xing'an Range in northeast China, the Yanshan-Liaoning, Xilamulum belts along the northern margin of the North China craton, the Qinling orogen, and the Middle-Lower Yangtze River Valley along the bonudaries between the North China and the Yangtze cratons. The occurrence of platform crbonate successions may have played some role in the evolution of ore fluids that resulted in the formation of porphyry-skarn deposits. The porphyry deposits of eastern China, although sharing some common features with classic porphyry systems that are related to convergent margins, do exhibit unusual features, particularly in terms of ore fluid compositions, the common presence of fluorite, hydrothermal alteration assemblages, which tend to be less hydrous than the porphyry at convergent margins. On the other hand, the porphyry mineral systems of eastern China have some similarities with the Climax-type porphyry. A major tectonothermal event (Yanshanian), which took place in the Jurassic-Cretaceous, affected eastern China and most of the eastern margin of Asia. This Yanshanian event was responsible for the magmatism and associated mineral systems in the region. The granitoid intrusions and accompanying porphyry and porphyry-skarn deposits were developed along orogenic belts and major structural discontinuities mostly along the tectonic boundaries between the North China and Yangtze cratons and between the northern margin of the North China craton and the Mongolia-Siberia plate. The porphyry and porphyry-skam deposits herein described include: Chalukou in the Great Xing'an Range orogen, Jiguanshan in the Xilamulun metallogenic belt, Xiaojiayingzi, Lanjiagou, Chehugou, Yuanbaoshan in the Yanshan-Liaoning belt, Nanninhu, Yuchiling, Jinduicheng, Lemeingou in the East Qinling orogen, Tongchakoou, Shaxi from the Middle-Lower-Yangtze River Valley. The role of mantle-lithosphere dynamics in eastern China, which led to the formation of these porphyry and porphyry-skarn mineral systems, is discussed and reviewed.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Sediment-hosted copper-silver mineralization in the Raipas Supergroup of the Repparfjord tectonic window of Finnmark, northernmost Norway, is present in two main stratigraphic horizons at Nussir and Ulveryggen. The stratigraphically lower Ulveryggen deposit is hosted by irregular lenses of dominantly fluviatile sandstone and conglomerate, whereas the Nussir deposit, with a strike length of 9 km, is associated with dolomitic siltstone and dolomite. Both deposits display intense structural control, and apart from the classic stratiform geometry of the disseminated cupriferous sulfides, high-grade mineralization includes abundant foliation parallel and transgressive veinlets, fissures, and irregular lenses and aggregates, with or without quartz, carbonate, chlorite, and biotite gangue. A close association with ductile deformation is apparent. Although scarce, molybdenite occurs intimately associated with the cupriferous sulfides at Nussir, in a paragenetic sequence comprising chalcopyrite-bomite-molybdenite-chalcocite-neodigenite in both the stratiform disseminated and veinlet mineralization.
   <br>U-Pb zircon dating of a tuffaceous horizon from the dominantly volcanic Nussir Group, collected 60 m above the ore horizon at Nussir, yielded an age of 2073.1 +23.21-12.4 Ma that confirms accumulation in an intercontinental rift or island-arc environment during construction of the Paleoproterozoic Columbia supercontinent. Re-Os geochronology on Nussir molybdenite returned ages of 1761 +/- 8 and 1768 +/- 7 Ma, which represent the timing of the copper-silver mineralization in the area. This age, the oldest direct, unambiguous determination reported for a sediment-hosted copper deposit, implies that the copper mineralization took place similar to 300 m.y. after the sedimentation and volcanism responsible for the host sequence, and syntectonically with the Svecofennian (Svecokarelian) orogeny in the Fennoscandian Shield.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>We present a new high-resolution shear-velocity model of the lithosphere (down to about 160 km) beneath China using Rayleigh-wave tomography. We combined ambient noise and earthquake data recorded at 1316 seismic stations, the largest number used for the region to date. More than 700,000 dispersion curves were measured to generate group and phase velocity maps at periods of 10-140 s. The resolution of our model is significantly improved over previous models with about 1-2 degrees in eastern China and 2-3 degrees in western China. We also derived models of the study region for crustal thickness and averaged S velocities for upper and mid-lower crust and uppermost mantle. These models reveal important lithospheric features beneath China and provide a fundamental data set for understanding continental dynamics and evolution. Different geological units show distinct features in the Moho depth, lithospheric thickness, and shear velocity. In particular, the North China Craton (NCC) lithosphere shows strong east-west structural variations with thin and low-velocity lithosphere in eastern NCC and thick and high-velocity lithosphere beneath western NCC and the lithosphere of the Ordos Block seems to have undergone strong erosion. The results support the progressive destruction of the NCC lithosphere from east to west at least partly caused by the thermal-chemical erosion of the cratonic lithosphere from the asthenosphere. Another pronounced feature of our model is the strong lateral variations of the mantle lithosphere beneath the Tibetan Plateau (TP). The Indian lithosphere beneath the TP shows variable northward advancement with nearly flat subduction in western and eastern TP and steep subduction in central TP with evidence for the tearing of Indian lithosphere beneath central TP, which may be important for the riftings at the surface in Himalayas and southern TP. The low-velocity zone in northern TP shows strong correlation with the region of the mid-Miocene to Quaternary potassic magmatism, suggesting that delamination of lithosphere may have played an important role in the rise of the TP.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>An extensive, northward deepening blanket of Neoproterozoic and Cambrian sedimentary rocks once extended from the Himalayan margin far onto the Indian craton. Cambrian deposits of this "upper Lesser Himalayan" succession, which include deposits of the "outer" Lesser Himalaya tectonic unit, are enriched in radiogenic Os-187. They make up part of a proximal marine fades belt that extends onto the craton and along strike from India to Pakistan. By contrast, age-equivalent facies in the Tethyan Himalaya are more distal in nature. Neoproterozoic to Cambrian strata of the upper Lesser Himalayan succession are now missing in much of the Lesser Himalaya, with their erosion exposing older Precambrian Lesser Himalayan strata. We suggest that exhumation and weathering of the upper Lesser Himalaya and related strata caused dramatic changes in the Os-187/Os-188 and Sr-87/Sr-86 Neogene record of seawater starting at similar to 16 Ma. First-order estimates for the volume of upper Himalayan strata, as well as the volume of all LH rock eroded since this time, and geochemical box modeling, support this idea. Exhumation at 16 Ma is a fundamental event in the evolution of the Himalayan orogeny and the geochemical evolution of the oceans, and will be a critical part of the construction of future models of Himalayan thrust belt evolution.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Mantiqueira Province in SE Brazil and Uruguay is a complex Brasiliano/Pan-African orogenic province that has recently been the topic of conflicting geodynamic models focusing the possibility of multiple collision events during the Ediacaran-Ordovician assembly of the Western Gondwana Supercontinent. A thorough compilation of recently obtained high-resolution U-Pb geochronology and geochemistry in the Mantiqueira Province provided the following results: (a) considering the entire orogenic system, the pre-, syn- and post-orogenic periods range from &gt;670-595 Ma, 620-550 Ma and 560-490 Ma, respectively, and are coeval with the intrusion of 3 distinct magmatic sequences within each geographic segment of this large orogenic province, evolving from: (i) calc-alkaline, arc-related magmatism; to (ii) syn-orogenic, anatectic magmatism coeval with the metamorphic climax; to (iii) calc-alkaline/alkaline (including shoshonitic and A-type affinity) magmatism that reveal significant lower crust and mantle contribution; (b) progressively younger ages are present from south to north, irrespective of the orogenic period considered, implying that the different geographic sectors were, from south to north, diachronically amalgamated into the Mantiqueira Province. Results provide important evidence for the existence of a single diachronic collision event at 630-590 Ma, followed by the thermal climax at 615-560 Ma, slab break-off, asthenospheric upwelling and mantle underplating that sustained long-term high heat flux conditions until 540-490 Ma, when post-tectonic calc-alkaline/alkaline granitoids (probably admixed with small amounts of slab melts formed at depth) intruded the middle/low-crust magmatic and metamorphic sequences during the final stages of thermal and orogenic collapse of the Mantiqueira Province belts.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Nanfen iron deposit, situated in the Anshan-Benxi area of the North China Craton (NCC), hosts scattered banded iron formations (BIFs) and BIF-hosted high-grade iron orebodies (defined by FeOT &gt;80 wt.%). The associated roof and bottom rocks, which occur in parallel to orebodies, are mica quartz schist and chlorite hornblende schist (locally interlayers), respectively. The PAAS-normalized rare earth element (REE) patterns indicate that quartz-magnetite banded iron formations (BIFs) are enriched in Heavy REEs with positive La, Eu and Y anomalies, indicating that the Nanfen BIF precipitated from a mixture of ambient seawater and submarine high-T hydrothermal fluids (similar to 0.1%). In addition, the BIF exhibits low concentrations of Al2O3 and TiO2 with depletion in HFSEs (high field strength elements, e.g., Nb, Ta, Zr, Hf and Ti), suggesting little contamination with continental detritus. Excepting lower Eu/Eu* values, the high-grade iron ores display similar geochemical features to the BIF, likely implying that they have a same iron source but did not form synchronously. Electron microprobe analyses (EMPA) and in situ LA-ICP-MS analyses reveal that in relative to the magnetite grains in high-grade ores, the magnetite grains in the BIF contain higher MnO, MgO and Zn concentrations, and lower Al2O3 and REE abundances, implying different formation conditions. Thus, we argue that high-grade ores are likely to be alteration products of primary BIFs. Chlorite hornblende schist (meta-basalt) samples exhibit low SiO2 contents (43.78-50.30 wt.%) with flat chondrite-normalized REE and N-MORB-normalized trace element patterns, which are similar to those of BABB (back-arc basin basalt). The zircon U-Pb dating results indicate that magmatic and metamorphic zircons from chlorite hornblende schist formed at approximately 2552 Ma and 2482 Ma, respectively. The former volcanic age could constrain the deposition age of the Nanfen BIF, and the latter reflects a subsequent metamorphic event, which is also reflected by the similar to 2480 Ma hydrothermal zircons selected from the BIF. Moreover, most zircons from chlorite hornblende schist have positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values (0.22-7.96) close to the depleted mantle evolutionary curve, implying that the source magma were derived from a depleted mantle with some contamination from ancient crust. Hence, we propose that the Nanfen BIF is a Neoarchean Algoma-type BIF, and its deposition was most likely benefited due to crustal growth. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Precambrian geology of the Tarim Craton, especially for the crustal evolution, is poorly constrained. Paleoproterozoic metasedimentary rocks are extensively exposed in the Kuluketage Block, northern Tarim Craton, and thus have recorded abundant geological information of its tectonic history. Supracrustal rocks within the Archean basement (Tuoge Complex) and the Paleoproterozoic Xingditage Group were collected from the Kuluketage Block for geochemical study and zircon U-Pb dating. The Tuoge supracrustal rocks have low CIA values between 45 and 63, indicating weak chemical weathering. Although the Xingditage Group shows a large variation of CIA values (37-67), their low average value suggests that they underwent similar weathering to the rocks from the basement. This similarity is also supported by their respective PIA values (mostly 43-57 for the basement rocks, and mostly 37-60 for the Xingditage Group). The high ICV values (mostly &gt;1) of both rock suites indicate an immature source that lacked alumina-rich minerals. Although these metasedimentary rocks show different REE patterns, they are all enriched in light rare earth element (LREE) and display relatively flat heavy rare earth element (HREE) patterns. The low values of ferromagnesian (e.g. Cr, Co and Ni) and high field strength elements (e.g. Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta and Y) are similar to those of graywackes from active continental margins. Therefore, the Kuluketage Block most likely evolved in an active continental margin setting during the late Paleoproterozoic. Detrital zircons from a slate sample of the Tuoge supracrustal rocks are dominated by igneous zircons, which mostly yield Paleoproterozoic 207pb/206Pb ages between 1.72 Ga and 2.08 Ga. Other igneous grains give Paleoproterozoic 207Pb/206Pb ages at 2.2 Ga and 2.32 Ga. All these igneous zircons show large variations of eFif(t) values mostly between 17 and 3, and have Neoarchean crustal model ages (TDm =2.6-3.7 Ga). Schist and quartzite samples of the upper Xingditage Group show similar age spectra to the slate and contain a major igneous zircon population with Paleoproterozoic formation ages (mostly 1.8-2.1 Ga) and Paleo- to Mesoarchean Tpmc ages (2.7-3.1 Ga). A schist sample of the lower Xingditage Group shows a much different age spectrum. Detrital zircons from this sample are dominated by Neoarchean grains (2.5-2.7 Ga) with Paleoarchean ibmc ages (3.14-3.51 Ga) and two of them yield the youngest ages at 1.94 and 2.09 Ga. The youngest zircons from these samples, therefore, define the maximum depositional ages at 1.63, 1.94 and 1.77 Ga for the Tuoge supracrustal rocks, the upper Xingditage Group and the lower Xingditage Group, respectively. On basis of these age spectra, we suggest that the Tuoge supracrustal rocks are equivalents of the upper Xingditage Group, instead of parts of the Archean basement. Overall, the Hf isotopic compositions of these detrital zircons indicate three early Precambrian crustal growth events in the Tarim Craton, which occurred in the late Paleoarchean, the early Neoarchean and at the beginning of the Paleoproterozoic. 2015 Elsevier B.V.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Proterozoic Capricorn Orogen is a major tectonic zone that records the assembly and subsequent reworking of the West Australian Craton. Recent seismic transects across the orogen have identified major crustal structures, some of which are spatially associated with hydrothermal mineral deposits. The sedimentary-rock-hosted Abra deposit, which is the largest base-metal accumulation in the Capricorn Orogen, is localized within the crust-cutting Lyons River-Quartzite Well fault zone. Robust radiometric dates for the timing of sediment deposition and hydrothermal mineralization are essential for understanding the geological history of this long-lived orogen and the processes that formed the ore deposits. In situ U-Pb SHRIMP geochronology of xenotime intergrown with magnetite-hematite-galena from the Abra ore zone yields a weighted mean 207 Pb/ 2 6 Pb age of 1594 10 Ma (n = 14, MSWD = 2.6) which is interpreted to represent a period of xenotime growth during the hydrothermal activity responsible for the mineralization. An older coherent cluster within this group gives a weighted mean age of 1610 16 Ma (n =5, MSWD =1.5), which constrains the depositional age of the lower Edmund Group sediments to between c. 1680 Ma (maximum age of the basal Mt Augustus Sandstone) and c. 1610 Ma. Authigenic monazite from the ore zone gives 207 Pb/ 2 6 Pb ages of 1375 14 (n =16, MSWD = 0.99) Ma, interpreted to represent a hydrothermal event postdating the main phase of mineralization. Monazites in samples distal to mineralization yield weighted mean 207Pb/206Pb ages of 1221 14 Ma (n=5, MSWD =1.04) and 995 18 Ma (n = 6, MSWD = 1.3), interpreted as records of discrete episodes of hydrothermal fluid flow. Our results suggest that the Lyons River-Quartzite Well Fault, which is one of the principal structures in the Capricorn Orogen, has a long history of tectonic reactivation, spanning more than 600 million years and involving crustal extension and sediment deposition, hydrothermal mineralization and multiple episodes of fluid flow. Xenotime and monazite represent ideal chronometers for investigating the complex histories of hydrothermal mineralization and fluid flow in major crustal structures, and helping to unravel the geological evolution of intracratonic orogens. 2015 Elsevier B.V.

SIMS zircon U-Pb analyses of a biotite granite (158.9 +/- 1.3 Ma), three two-mica granites (stage I: 159.7 +/- 1.2 Ma, stage II: 158.6 +/- 1.2 Ma and 156.8 +/- 1.2 Ma) and a muscovite granodiorite (159.0 +/- 4.4 Ma) of the Jiufeng pluton suggest that they are coeval and were emplaced in a short period of no more than 5.3 m.y. Limited variations in whole-rock Nd isotope (epsilon Nd(t) = -12.6 to -9.5) and zircon Hf-O isotopes (epsilon Hf(t) = - 12.0 to -6.3, delta O-18 = 6.8 parts per thousand - 9.4 parts per thousand) suggest that the Jiufeng pluton was mainly derived from melting of a common metasedimentary source, possibly with a minor basaltic contribution. We consider the geochemical variations of the Jiufeng pluton are primarily a result of incremental assembly of magma batches produced from rapid step-like transition from fluid-saturated to fluid-absent melting of the source. The muscovite granodiorite, with high Na2O (&gt;3.80 wt.%; K2O/Na2O = similar to 1), is interpreted to have been produced by fluid-saturated melting at low temperature (similar to 650 degrees C). High P2O5 (0.09-0.17 wt.%), zircon saturation temperature (T-Zr = 769-816 degrees C) and La/Yb ratios (8.4-55.8) of the stage II two-mica granite support its formation from high-temperature (&gt;800 degrees C) biotite-dehydration melting, whereas lower P2O5 (&lt;0.02wt.%), T-Zr (685-742 degrees C) and La/Yb (&lt;3) of the stage I two-mica granite suggest its generation at lower temperature, likely by muscovite-dehydration melting. We propose that extensive emplacement of basaltic melts in the lower crust most likely drove the rapid increase of mid-crustal (similar to 20 km) temperature (similar to 50 degrees C/m.y.) and widespread crustal melting for the formation of the Jurassic South China LGP. Therefore, formation of the LGP signifies prominent crustal growth as well as crustal reworking in an intraplate setting and was likely a response to flat-slab delamination and foundering.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Mercury's global tectonic history is thought to have been dominated by two major processes: tidal despinning and global contraction. Each process is expected to have produced a distinctive global stress field and resultant fault pattern. Thousands of thrust-fault-related landforms documented on Mercury can be attributed to global contraction, but no global signature of tidal despinning has been conclusively documented. Because global contraction operated throughout an extended portion of Mercury's geologic history, any tidal despinning pattern either would have formed together with global contraction, or would have been modified by global contraction after despinning was complete. Here, we reassess global fracture patterns predicted to result from tidal despinning and from a combination of tidal despinning and global contraction. We specifically make use of rock strength and deformability parameters appropriate for Mercury's fractured lithosphere. Results indicate that a tidal despinning pattern would consist only of a global set of opening-mode fractures (joints) in the upper part of the lithosphere, whereas the combination of tidal despinning and global contraction would have produced a global population of thrust faults, with no preferred orientations in the polar regions but with an increasing preference for north-south orientations toward the equator. If an equatorial bulge from an early state of rapid spin was supported by Mercury's lithosphere, two end-member scenarios for the timing and duration of these two processes may be considered. In one, tidal despinning predated global contraction; in the other, tidal despinning and global contraction overlapped in time. We test the predictions of both scenarios against the distribution and orientations of Mercury's tectonic landforms. The global pattern of thrust faults is generally consistent with predictions for the scenario under which tidal despinning and global contraction temporally overlapped. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>How sediment grain size corresponds to both climate change and tectonics is increasingly the focus of debate. The shrinkage and migration of the huge paleo-lake in the western Qaidam Basin (WQB), NE Tibetan Plateau (TP) provide an excellent case study. We present a nearly 6 Ma well-dated high-resolution grain size record from the 723-m-deep drill core SG-1b (located in the Jianshan Anticline in the WQB) to show how sediment grain size responds to anticline growth and climate change. The results show that variations in grain size represent three distinct phases. Phase I(7.3-3.6 Ma) is characterized by fine sediments with good sorting, with a predominance of clay and fine silt. During this phase, the drilling site was in a deep to semi-deep lake environment, the Jianshan Anticline has undergone relatively weak tectonics and the climate was dry, but still much wetter than that in the Quaternary; grain size variation and lacustrine deposition were principally controlled by climate. Phase II (similar to 3.6-33 Ma) was a transitional period characterized by a rapid shift toward consistently coarser sediments with increased volumes of medium-coarse silt and sand. During this phase, the drilling site underwent a dramatic shift to a shallow lake environment, the anticline experienced rapid uplift and the climate was in an episode of rapid drying; grain size variation and lacustrine deposition were principally controlled by tectonics in the Jianshan Anticline. Phase III (similar to 3.3-1.6 Ma) was a period exhibiting a long-term fining trend in mean grain size relative to Phase II, but still much coarser than that of Phase I, and with a distinct and prolonged increase in very fine sediments accompanied by poor sorting. During this phase, the drilling site was in a shallow lake environment between 3.3 Ma and 1.9 Ma, and finally became a lakeshore-like environment between 1.9 Ma and 1.6 Ma; the anticline experienced rapid and continuous uplift and the climate was in a long-term stepwise drying and cooling trend. A conceptual model was drawn to show how grain size and lacustrine deposition responded to uplift of the Jianshan Anticline and climate change in the Qaidam Basin. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In this paper, we report cosmogenic isotope evidence for dramatic changes in sediment supply during glacial interglacial climatic cycles in the Late Quaternary. Previous work on fluvio-glacial processes in cold environments has qualitatively revealed that significant increases in debris production occurred in glacial periods, due typically to accelerated glacial and periglacial processes on high-relief slopes, resulting in river aggradation (accumulation) in the drainage. In interglacial periods, rivers behave in the opposite way, forming incised valleys. However, little has been studied on climatically controlled production-and-reworking processes with radiometric evidence. The evidence presented here is from the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, where lateral growth of the plateau is now ongoing. Reconstructions of fluvial response to Quaternary glacial fluctuations are crucial also to better understand the active tectonic process in the region using geomorphological information. The Sijiquan River drainage basin on the north of the East Kunlun Mountains was investigated. Detailed geomorphological mapping of fluvio-glacial landforms indicates two phases of aggradation, each of which was followed by valley incision. Be-10 and Al-26 concentrations in fluvial terrace deposits suggest that these two aggradational phases correspond most likely to the penultimate and last glacial periods, assuming a low rate of surface erosion on the terraces and zero inherited concentration. On the other hand, present-day river gravel has higher concentrations in amalgamated samples of Be-10 and Al-26 than the terrace deposits. Surface-exposure and burial analyses based on grain-by-grain measurements of both Be-10 and Al-26 indicate that the present-day river gravel consists mostly of reworked grains from terrace deposits and underlying fluviolacustrine rocks in the drainage basin. It is concluded that significant changes in clastic sediment supply occur in cold environments in response to glacial interglacial cycles; clastic sediments are transported from mountain slopes much more directly in glacial periods than in interglacial periods. This violates the common assumption for surface exposure dating that the inherited cosmogenic isotope concentration is constant through time. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

   <br>Mineralization in the Triassic series has led to the presence of several metals and metalloids in groundwater, including As, Mn, Fe and U. These are associated with fresher bicarbonate groundwaters, characterized by lower Sr/Ba ratios. Levels containing sulfate evaporitic salt, which are interbedded through the Triassic series, seem to exert a strong influence on the chemistry of several groundwaters, characterized by calcium sulfate fades with high Sr concentration and high Sr/Ba ratios.
   <br>The application of multivariate statistical techniques to the interpretation of analytical results allows the differentiation of groundwater types occurring in the Triassic aquifers and identification of the role of a number of minor or trace elements and their ratios that can be treated as hydrogeochemical tracers. With them it was possible to correlate the different recharge waters with the tectonic morphology of the Espaclan-Calderona Triassic Domain. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Late Weichselian Tinglev outwash plain in southwestern Denmark slopes gently from east to west, but certain areas of the topography show unusual irregularities. Analysis of LiDAR data reveals a mosaic of smaller areas with pronounced changes in slope magnitude and orientation between neighbouring areas. The outwash plain also features notable changes in elevation across kilometre-long lineaments and areas lying lower and higher than the expected level. The depressions in the area have previously been interpreted as the result of melting dead-ice blocks left by the Late Weichselian ice sheet. However, borehole samples from Lake Tinglev on the outwash plain show that lake sedimentation did not start until the early Holocene (9000 years ago), which is more than 9000 years after the ice sheet had retreated. The topographical irregularities are located above the TOnder Graben structure, and we interpret these as the result of Holocene strike-slip movements along the graben faults resulting in areas of both subsidence and uplift. The deformations of the outwash plain are interpreted as the effect of deglaciation tectonics acting within a limited time frame at the beginning of the Holocene. As the event can be related to stress release from the weight of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet, we expect that other fault zones in northern Europe would be equally prone to reactivation. Tectonic events related to deglaciation would most likely be recurrent, and the stress changes appear to have been able to induce short-lived tectonic instability to areas normally considered tectonically stable. We conclude that this type of tectonics has had a significant impact on topography and sedimentation throughout the Quaternary.</td>

A comparison of U-Pb bedrock and detrital zircon ages in arcs with independent calculations of volumetric magma addition rates (MARs) indicates that the former nicely track the episodic temporal histories of arc magmatism but not MARs. MAR estimates indicate that 100-1000 times more magmatism is added to continental arcs during flare-ups than during lulls and result in plutonic/volcanic ratios of &gt;30/1. Episodic arc magmatism may result from external forcing on arc systems caused by events outside the arc and/or from internal cyclic processes driven by feedback between linked tectonic and magmatic processes within the arc. Along and across arc strike, changes and asymmetries in magmatic, tectonic, and geochemical histories provide important constraints for evaluating these poorly understood driving mechanisms.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Two end-member models have been invoked to accommodate the Mesozoic dispersal of the supercontinent Pangaea. In one end-member, the opening of the Atlantic Ocean is inferred to have been balanced by the closure of the Panthalassan Ocean related to subduction off the western margins of the Americas. In the other end-member model, the opening of the Atlantic Ocean is accommodated by the closure of the paleo-Tethys and Tethys oceans linked to subduction off the southern margins of Eurasia. Here, I re-evaluate global plate circulation data compiled for the middle Mesozoic Era. The present evaluation confirms that closure of the paleo-Tethys and Tethys oceans compensated for the early opening of the central Atlantic and proto-Caribbean oceans. This result implies that the tectonic evolution of the North American Cordillera was independent from the processes governing Pangaea breakup in the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous Periods. As well, the opening Atlantic and closing Tethys realm must have been tectonically connected through the Mediterranean region in terms of a transform fault or point yet to be factored into geological interpretations. Tight geometric and kinematic correlations evident between the opening Atlantic and closing Tethyan domains can be demonstrated, which are most readily explained if the forces causing Pangaea breakup were transmitted from the Tethyan domain into the Atlantic domain, and not vice versa. Thus, slab sinking-based forces produced during the evolution of the Tethyan subduction zones are hypothesized to have controlled the early Atlantic breakup of Pangaea.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Synconvergent extension within orogenic systems is often interpreted as gravitational spreading of thickened crust or as a response to thrust belt dynamics. However, the processes that spatially localize extension during orogenesis are not fully understood. Here, a case study from the United States Cordillera demonstrates that localized upper-crustal thickening can exert a first-order control on the spatial location of synorogenic extension. The Eureka culmination, a 20-km-wide, north-trending anticline with 4.5 km of structural relief in the hinterland plateau of the Sevier orogenic belt (or "Nevadaplano") in eastern Nevada was deformed by two sets of north-striking normal faults that pre-date late Eocene volcanism. (U-Th)/He and fission-track thermochronology data collected from Paleozoic quartzite in the footwalls of two normal faults demonstrate rapid (10 degrees C/m.y.), Late Cretaceous to Paleocene (75-60 Ma) cooling, which we interpret as tectonic exhumation during extension, and which was concurrent with late-stage shortening in the frontal Sevier thrust belt. This example illustrates that structural and topographic relief generated within zones of localized upper-crustal thickening can spatially focus extension during orogenesis, and adds to a growing body of evidence that Late Cretaceous-Paleocene extension in the Nevadaplano occurred at both mid-and upper-crustal levels.</td>

Earlier models that explained S1 by bedding-parallel shearing are rejected. The Sa'al volcanism, D1 extension and HT metamorphism were probably associated with back-arc rifting in a continental arc setting, similar to the modern Taupo Zone of New Zealand. Later deformations, D2 and D3, involved folding about NE-trending and NW-trending axial planes, respectively. D2 was probably a result of compressional stresses typical of continental back-arc regions, and resulted in development of steep NW-vergent imbricate thrusts and NE-trending F2 meso- and macrofolds. The Firinga gabbro and the Wadi Murad foliated diorite intruded along D2 backthrusts, while the main diorite intrusion dominating the centre of the complex intruded along D2 steepened imbricate thrusts. F3 deformation may be related to the latest convergence of the east and west Gondwana, and has correlatives in the Kid and Feiran Complexes. A final deformation D4 that generated the main strike-slip faults in the area correlates with NESW trending sigma 1, inconsistent with a Najd origin. Recent geochronological results from U/Pb zircon studies are difficult to reconcile with stratigraphic and intrusion field evidence, and apparently require very tight time constraints on the main metamorphism, D1 and D2 deformations of the complex.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Eastern New Zealand Oceanic Sedimentary System is influenced by the main deep cold-water inflow to the Pacific Ocean, the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC). ODP Leg 181 targeted this region. The two northern sites ODP 1123 and 1124 are mainly used for interpretation of DWBC flow. Newly acquired high-resolution seismic reflection profiles directly cross ODP Site 1122 in the Outer Bounty Trough area. We can decipher the first appearance of a branch of the DWBC meandering into the Bounty Trough as early as 20 to 16.7 Ma. We identified four different drift deposits of the DWBC in the Outer Bounty Trough area. The deepest two drifts were formed before the opening of the Tasmanian Gateway and thus provide the first evidence of a pre-Oligocene deep circulation at the eastern New Zealand margin. Additionally, migration of the drift crests to the west and to the east is interpreted to indicate modifications in core flow pathway of the DWBC due to response to climate changes (Eocene cooling, cooling due to West Antarctic Ice shield build-up), tectonic influence (opening of Tasmanian Gateway) and enhanced sediment input (first turbiditic deposits of Bounty Channel).

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Triassic Karakaya Complex (KC) of the Sakarya Composite Terrane in northern Turkey is traditionally subdivided into two units. The Lower Karakaya Complex (LKC) consists of a tectonic m,lange with blocks of metabasic rocks, metacarbonates, meta-arenites and metapelites that have been affected by high pressure/low temperature metamorphism. It is followed by a low pressure/low temperature metamorphic overprint; the latter is the only metamorphic event in some tectonic slivers of the LKC. The Upper Karakaya Complex (UKC) units are primarily composed of diagenetic to low-grade metamorphic rocks, comprising Late Permian and Triassic cherts and blocks of OIB-type volcanic rocks interfingering with Anisian limestones. LKC slide-blocks of variable sizes are frequently observed within the UKC. Phyllosilicates of LKC and UKC were examined for their abundance, crystallinity, polytype and b cell dimension. Trioctahedral chamositic chlorites have IIb polytype and phengites 2 M (1) polytypes in the LKC units and 2 M (1) + 1 M + 1M (d) polytypes of phengitic dioctahedral illites in the UKC units. Kubler index data correspond to the low anchizone and epizone for the LKC units, and to the high diagenesis-low anchizone, and in part to the epizone for the UKC units. The b values of illites are consistent with a high-pressure facies series for the LKC, but only intermediate-pressure facies for the UKC. According to textural features, mineral paragenesis, clay transformations, index minerals, and b values, the lower-middle parts of the LKC represent an accretional tectonic setting, whereas the UKC units reflect pressure temperature conditions of an extensional basin affected by high heat flow.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Davarzan-Abbasabad Eocene Volcanics (DAEV) is located at the northeastern edge of the volcanic-plutonic belt of the Central Iran structural zone. DAEV start with continental to shallow marine sediments of the Paleocene-Eocene and then continue extensively with shallow submarine to sub-aerial basaltic and andesitic volcanics, related volcaniclastics and sedimentary rocks during the Middle-Upper Eocene. The volcanics are olivine basalts, basaltic andesites and andesites in composition and show porphyric, hyaloporphyritic, glomeroporphyric, fluidal, and seriate textures. The geochemistry of DAEV points to a fractional series from olivine basalt to andesite with transitional and medium to high K calc-alkaline nature. Their primitive mantle and chondrite-normalized trace element patterns show that these rocks have high light- and low heavy rare earth elements and are enriched in large-ion lithophile elements and depleted in high field strength elements (Nb, Ti, P, and Zr). Integration of geochemical and petrological data with regional studies indicates that the magma(s) forming the DAEV rocks were derived from 14 to 16 % partial melting of an enriched mantle source in 70-100 km depths during Middle-Upper Eocene time in an intra-arc extensional setting. This mantle source had been previously metasomatized by fluids derived from Sabzevar Neo-Tethyan-subducted slab during the Upper Cretaceous-Paleocene.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Bedrock canyons are ubiquitous on Earth and Mars, and river canyon morphology is commonly used to interpret the climatic and tectonic histories of landscapes(1-3). On both planets, however, many bedrock canyons exist in dry, wind-dominated environments(4-6). Although wind abrasion can significantly influence the evolution of arid landscapes(4,7), the role of wind in shaping arid bedrock canyon systems is poorly understood and thus typically neglected. Here we exploit a natural experiment on the western slope of the central Andes that allows direct comparison of wind-affected and wind-protected canyons. Through a combined analysis of the morphology of 36 canyons and topographic wind simulations, we show that wind abrasion can amplify bedrock canyon incision rates by an order of magnitude above fluvial rates. Our results imply that wind can extend bedrock canyons-landforms traditionally thought to evolve only from flowing water. Furthermore, our analyses reveal a direct relationship between aerodynamics and landscape evolution on varying scales. Topographic shielding of high winds by mountains modulates the pace of canyon retreat, while individual canyon profiles become aerodynamically streamlined. We conclude that wind abrasion can significantly modify the morphology of bedrock canyons and suggest that wind may have similarly reshaped fluvial landscapes on the martian surface.</td>

This paper conducted a systematic study on the magmatism and metallogenic effect in the ore-concentrated area using techniques of isotopic geochronology, isotopic geochemistry and lithogeochemistry. According to the results, the crystallization age of quartz diorite (ore-forming mother rock) in the Ga'erqiong deposit is 87.1 +/- 0.4Ma, which is later than the age of granodiorite (ore-forming mother rock) in the Galale deposit (88.1 +/- 1.0Ma). The crystallization age of granite porphyry (GE granite porphyry) in the Ga'erqiong deposit is 83.2 +/- 0.7Ma, which is later than the age of granite porphyry (GL granite porphyry) in the Galale deposit (84.7 +/- 0.8Ma).The quartz diorite, granodiorite, GE granite porphyry and GL granite porphyry both main shows positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values, suggesting that the magmatic source of the main intrusions in the ore-concentrated area has the characteristics of mantle source region. The Re-Os isochron age of molybdenite in the Ga'erqiong district is 86.9 +/- 0.5Ma, which is later than the mineralization age of the Galale district (88.6 +/- 0.6Ma). The main intrusive rocks in the ore-concentrated area have similar lithogeochemical characteristics, for they both show the relative enrichment in large-ion lithophile elements(LILE: Rb, Ba, K, etc.), more mobile highly incompatible lithophile elements(HILE: U, Th) and relatively depleted in high field strength elements (HFSE: Nb, Ta, Zr, Hf, etc.), and show the characteristics of magmatic arc. The studies on the metal sulfides' S and Pb isotopes and Re content of molybdenite indicate that the metallogenic materials of the deposits in the ore-concentrated area mainly come from the mantle source with minor crustal source contamination. Based on the regional tectonic evolution process, this paper points out that the Ga'erqiong-Galale copper-gold ore-concentrated area is the typical product of the Late Cretaceous magmatism and metallogenic event in the collision stage of the Bangong-Nujiang suture zone.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Age determinations of the Triassic lithostratigraphic units of the Yanshan belt were previously based on plant fossils and regional correlations of lithologies. The Liujiagou and Heshanggou Formations were assigned as the Lower Triassic, and the Ermaying Formation was regarded as the Middle Triassic. We carried out a geochronologic study of detrital zircon grains from the Triassic sandstone in the Xiabancheng and Yingzi basins in northern Hebei where the Triassic strata are exceptionally well preserved. The results show that the Liujiagou, Heshanggou, and Ermaying Formations are all Late Triassic in age. The ages of detrital zircons also revealed that the upper part of the Shihezi Formation and the overlying Sunjiagou Formation, both of which were thought to be the Middle-Late Permian units, are actually late Early to Middle Triassic deposits. This study combines the upper Shihezi and Sunjiagou Formations into a single unit termed as the Yingzi Formation. We also substitute the widely-used Liujiagou, Heshanggou, and Ermaying Formations with the Dingjiagou, Xiabancheng, and Huzhangzi Formations, respectively. Field observations and facies analysis show that the top of the Shihezi Formation is an erosive surface, marking a parallel unconformity between the Middle Permian and Lower Triassic. The Yingzi Formation is composed mainly of meandering river deposits, indicative of tectonic quiescence and low-relief landform in the Early to Middle Triassic. In contrast, the Dingjiagou, Xiabancheng, and Huzhangzi Formations are interpreted as the deposits of sandy/gravelly braided rivers, alluvial fans, fan deltas, and deep lakes in association with volcanism, thus indicating an intense rifting setting. A new Triassic lithostratigraphic division is proposed according to age constraints and facies analysis, and the results are of significance for understanding the early Mesozoic tectonic evolution of the Yanshan belt.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Mesozoic tectonic architecture of the Korean peninsula is largely governed by the continental collision between the North and South China blocks. Zircon Hf isotopic compositions presented in this study and whole-rock geochemical and Sr-Nd isotope data in the literature collectively suggest that the lithophile-elements-enriched signature of the Late Triassic post-collisional plutons from the Gyeonggi massif in central Korea is a primary feature inherited from the metasomatized mantle lithosphere. Highly negative zircon epsilon(Hf) (t) values (-23 to -19) of plutons from the middle and eastern parts of the massif indicate an ancient metasomatism of their mantle source. Distinctly higher zircon epsilon(Hf) (t) values (-15 to -12) from the southwestern plutons are ascribed to a contribution from an accreted component of the South China-like block. The involvement of asthenospheric mantle is not recognized in zircons from either group. The implications of these isotopic features are discussed in the context of Mesozoic collisional tectonics.</td>

Although classical geological data suggest that the western Cordillera front is inactive, recent GPS data show a westward-north-westward motion of up to 3.4mma(-1) with respect to the foreland. In addition, the increasing thickness of Guadalquivir sedimentary infill towards the Cordillera, and the rectilinear character of the front formed by soft sediments, suggest that the Cordillera is still active. Large ENE-WSW-oriented open folds detected in the field, seismic reflection profiles and new audiomagnetotellurics data are consistent with active deformation. Fracture analysis in Quaternary deposits evidences recent NW-SE horizontal compression. The GPS motion and maximum stress orientation may be due to north-westward tectonic collision of the westernmost Betic Cordillera, accommodated at depth by active continental subduction of the Iberian lithosphere.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Shengli River-Changshe Mountain oil shale zone, including the Changliang Mountain-Shengli River oil shale, the Shengli River North oil shale, and the Changshe Mountain oil shale, represents potentially the largest marine oil shale resource in China. New geochemical data from the Shengli River North oil shale are presented to evaluate potentially hazardous trace elements in oil shale and to discuss possible factors controlling the geochemical anomalies. Oil shale samples from the Shengli River North area are characterized by high ash yield (59.25-66.27 %) and TOC content (4.77-9.35 %) with low total sulfur content (0.1-1.56 %) and intermediate shale oil content (3.60-16.30 %). Minerals in the Shengli River North oil shale include calcite, clay minerals, quartz, dolomite, and Fe-bearing minerals (e.g., pyrite, limonite, and hematite), and trace amounts of zeolite, apatite, and barite. Potentially hazardous trace elements in oil shale samples include As, Se, Mo, F, Ni, Cd, and Hg. Arsenic is present probably in both organic and inorganic matter. Selenium is controlled mainly by Fe-bearing (probably pyrite), while F and Cd occur mainly as apatite. The organically bound Mo and Ni are dominant, and Hg probably occurs as a substitution in the structure of pyrite, apatite and calcite. The elevated concentrations of F and Cd in the Shengli River North oil shale may be related to sediment source. Water chemistry may have played an important role for Ni and Mo enrichments, while the enrichment of Se in the oil shale samples is possibly related to hydrothermal fluids. Other elements including Hg and As are probably related to several factors.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This paper describes the lateral spreading landslides, the weathering processes and the hydrogeological risk patterns of the NW sector of Monte Poro (Calabria, southern Italy), based on the development of a multidisciplinary research. The tectonic uplift of the area combined with the litho-structural features of the sedimentary deposits overlying the intensely weathered granitoid complex produces important gravitational phenomena characterized by lateral spreading kinematics. The contact between deposits with a different behaviour, together with the high slope energy related to the tectonic uplift processes, is the main cause of widespread fracturing and disjoint of the lithologies associated with lateral spreading phenomena. These phenomena are also testified by the various trenches and cracks characterized by a parallel orientation relatively to the main fluvial incisions. Measures of these deformations were obtained with a quantitative result by the use of "Interferometric Stacking" methods. The experimental results confirm this morphological scenario characterized by strain values ranging between 20 and 25 mm/year relatively to the landslides detected. Geomorphological analysis of the drainage basins in the study area indicates a juvenile stage of the stream networks. This pattern is consistent with the high rate of tectonic uplift of the area, hence the continuous rejuvenation of the stream networks and their low level of hierarchy. These conditions of geomorphic equilibrium of the stream networks, the widespread occurrence of geological instability in continuous evolution, are the main causes of high hydrogeological risk conditions for this coastal area.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Langshan Range is located in the western Yin Mountain orogenic belts and the western Hetao fault-depression zone in Inner Mongolia, northern China. This area is on the northwestern margin of the East Asian monsoon region. The fluvial terraces in the transverse drainage of the Langshan Range represent a primary geo-morphic response to local tectonic uplift and climatic changes. The terrace evolution was reconstructed using a combination of optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating and terrace tread measurements. The terraces, designated T4 through T1, were abandoned at about 58.00, 4625, 32.19, and 15.79 ka BP, respectively. Their aggradation occurred primarily during cold periods of the last glacial stage, and incision occurred primarily during shifts from cold to warm climate stages. Geomorphic analysis showed the terrace heights were controlled by the tectonic uplift in the area. Differences in river incision rates and terrace geomorphic features indicate that the uplift of the Langshan Range included a component of tilting north to south during the period of 58.00-41.28 ka BP, whereas the uplift of the Langshan area tended to be equal on a regional scale after 32.19 ka BP.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The importance of Earth's low sloping areas in regard to global erosion and sediment fluxes has been widely and vigorously debated. It is a crucial area of research to elucidate geologically meaningful rates of land-surface change and thus the speed of element cycling on Earth. However, there are large portions of Earth where erosion rates have not been well or extensively measured, for example, the tropical lowlands. The Cuiabana lowlands are an extensive low-altitude and low-relief dissected metamorphic terrain situated in the Upper Paraguay river basin, central-west Brazil. Besides exposures of highly variable dissected metamorphic rocks, flat residual lateritic caps related to a Late Cenozoic planation surface dominate interfluves of the Cuiabana lowlands. The time-scale over which the lowlands evolved and the planation surface developed, and the rate at which they have been modified by erosion, are poorly known. Here, we present measurements of in situ produced cosmogenic Be-10 in outcropping metamorphic bedrock and clastic-lateritic caps to quantify rates of erosion of the surface and associated landforms in order to better understand the Quaternary landscape evolution of these lowlands. Overall, slow erosion rates (mean 10 m/Ma) suggest a stable tectonic environment in these lowlands. Erosion rates vary widely between different lithologies (range 0.57 to 28.3 m/Ma) consistent with differential erosion driving regional landform evolution. The lowest erosion rates are associated with the low-relief area (irregular plains), where clastic-laterite (mean 0.67 m/Ma) and quartzite (mean 2.6 m/Ma) crop out whereas the highest erosion rates are associated with dissection of residual hills, dominated by metasandstone (mean 11.6 m/Ma) and phyllite (mean 27.6 m/Ma). These data imply that the Cuiabana lowland is comprised of two dominant landform sets with distinct and different dynamics. Because the planation surface (mostly lowlands) is lowering and losing mass more slowly than associated residual hills, regional relief is decreasing over time and the landscape is not in steady state. The extremely slow erosion rates of the clastic-laterite are similar to the slowest outcrop erosion rates reported worldwide. These slow rates are due to the material's properties and resistance, being comprised of quartzite fragments cemented by an iron-rich crust, and reflecting long-term weathering with iron chemical precipitation and ferricrete formation, at least since the Middle Pleistocene. The lateritic caprock appears to be a key factor maintaining hilltop summits of the planation surface over long timescales. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

In this paper ASTER DEM data (30-m pixel size) are used to derive empirical relationships between triangular facet attributes and slip rates along active normal faults. We sampled 232 triangular facets along 10 normal faults in Greece and Bulgaria that slip with rates from 0.1 mm/yr up to 1.3 mm/yr. The studied normal faults accumulate Quaternary tectonic strain in well-known extensional provinces, such as central Greece, Crete and SW Bulgaria. The normal fault footwalls analyzed herein have been developed under similar long-term climatic conditions. It is suggested that two key geometrical features of the youngest generation of triangular facets (slope angle and height) can provide useful metrics to assess rates of deformation when seismological and geodetic data are lacking or not found in sufficient quantity to make reasonable assessments. Our derived empirical relation between slip rate and facet slope angle is: Y = 0.057 x X - 1 where Y is the fault slip rate (mm/yr) and Xis the facet slope angle (degrees), with an R-2 = 0.728. It is envisaged that our analysis may be helpful in assessing seismic hazard along normal faults with similar facet characteristics in other extensional settings. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Mud volcanoes are common geological phenomenons observed worldwide as in Italy. They are well described in the scientific literature for their morphological, tectonic and hydrogeological features. They represent not only a relevant geological and geomorphological interest but also not negligible elements of hazard and risk associated with the presence of soft and pliable sediments and with the possible unexpected emission of gas and mud. Therefore, the understanding of their structure and hydrogeological circuits in the subsurface is an important key to define hazard and risk conditions in the adjacent areas.
   <br>This paper deals with a multidisciplinary study including geophysical and hydrochemical surveys undertaken at the Pineto (central Italy) mud volcano site to achieve an interpretative conceptual model explaining the shallow upward migration of deep mud fluids. Shallow electrical and seismic imaging of the mud volcano was obtained using two dimensional and three dimensional (2D-3D) electrical resistivity tomography and 2D reflection seismic surveys. The hydrochemical properties of the rising fluids were assessed by means of seasonal measurements of the chemical-physical parameters, the concentrations of major ions, and some natural isotopes. This mud volcano or mud lump appears as a dome of about 15 x 10 m in size. The height of the crater is 2 m approximately, while the diameter of the crater is 25 m. Emission of fluids and solids (cold brine, mud, gas) occurs from this crater. Upper Pliocene-lower Pleistocene foredeep pelitic deposits (over-compacted clays with silty-sandy levels) overlain by clayey-silty deposits crop out in the area. The survey results seem to reveal that the uprising of deep fluids does not occur exactly below the mud volcano at present. Instead, a high conductivity body is present within a fractured zone in the pelitic deposits at 60 m approximately to the ENE. The probable occurrence of a high permeability layer approximately between 20 and 30 m below ground level, confined by clay deposits, gives rise to an overpressured mud fluids reservoir. Mud fluids appear to be flowing toward the surface from the reservoir up to the mud volcano crater. The interpretative conceptual model proposed by the authors is a first attempt to explain the shallow upward migration of deep mud fluids in this central Italy mud volcano. The results can be used to identify the uprising of fluids with similar chemical-physical properties even in areas where the superficial and morphological evidence of the volcanic bodies have been obliterated or covered.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Jiangnan Orogen is considered as a continent-continent collisional belt resulting from the closure of a Meso-Neoproterozoic ocean separating the southeastern margin of the Yangtze Block from the northwestern margin of the Cathaysia Block. Recent data indicate the existence of early Neoproterozoic (1000-825 Ma) volcanic arc assemblages on both sides of the orogen, suggesting that the ocean lithosphere between the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks must have undergone divergent double-sided subduction during the period of 1000-825 Ma. The divergent double subduction eventually resulted in the closure of the ocean basin at similar to 825 Ma, leading to the soft collision of the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks to form the Jiangnan Orogen, without involvement of continental deep subduction, high-grade metamorphism of continental crust and uplift/exhumation of high-grade metamorphic rocks. Shortly after the collision, the initial detachment of the ocean lithosphere from the overlying crust and sedimentary sections induced underplating of mantle magmas, triggering partial melting of accretionary-wedge strata to form some peraluminous (S-type) granites in the period 825-815 Ma Finally, the sinking of the oceanic slab pulled down the overlying strata to form some basins in which the Banxi Group and its equivalent strata including bimodal volcanic rocks were formed in the period 815-750 Ma.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The relationship between the Alashan Terrane and North China is a contentious issue given the discovery of allochthonous detrital zircons in Middle Ordovician flysch sandstones from the southwestern Ordos Margin and the large differences in palaeolatitudes between the North China and Tarim cratons. We have collected a suite of Middle to Late Devonian sedimentary rocks from the Niushoushan Mountains at the southeastern margin of the Alashan Terrane, adjacent to the western margin of the Ordos Basin of the North China Craton (NCC). U-Pb dating and Lu-Hf isotopic studies were carried out on detrital zircons from these rocks. The zircon U-Pb ages define five age populations: 0.4-0.7 Ga (peak at 488 Ma), 1.0-1.3 Ga (peaks at 1001 and 1152 Ma), 1.5-1.8 Ga, 2.4-2.8 Ga (prominent peak at 2506 Ma and secondary peaks at 2668 and 2796 Ma) and &gt;3.0 Ga (peak at 3332 Ma). One detrital zircon yielded a Hadean age of 4022 +/- 17 Ma. Zircons with U-Pb age spectra of 2.4-2.7 and &gt;3.0 Ga and their corresponding epsilon(Hf(t)) values are significantly different from those in the NCC, indicating that these detrital zircons are not from the NCC, which implies that the Alashan Terrane was not part of North China until the Middle to Late Devonian. U-Pb age spectra of zircons dated at 1.0-13 Ga, 2.4-2.7 Ga, and &gt;3.0 Ga, and their corresponding Hf isotope data, have a strong similarity with zircons from East Gondwana and the South China Craton.

The Xin'anzhai monzogranite yields zircon U-Pb age of 251.6 +/- 2.0 Ma and epsilon(Hf)(t) values of -62 - -9.8. The Tongtiange leucogranite gives zircon U-Pb age of 247.5 +/- 2.2 Ma and epsilon(Hf)(t) values ranging from -3.1 to -11.1. The Tongtiange leucogranites have lower MgO, Na2O, CaO, FeOt and TiO2 contents but higher A/CNK values than those of the Xin'anzhai monzogranites. The epsilon(Nd)(t) values for Xin'anzhai and Tongtiange plutons are in the range of -8.5 to -8.8 and -10.6 to -11.4, respectively, similar to those of the Ailaoshan metamorphic basement. The Tongtiange leucogranites are the product of dehydration melting of mica-rich metasedimentary rocks whereas the primary source of the Xin'anzhai monzogranites is probably Proterozoic gneiss with an addition of 35-45% Proterozoic amphibolite. Our geochronological results, together with other published data, indicate the presence of Permo-Triassic magmatism associated with the Indosinian Orogeny along the Ailaoshan suture zone. This zone links with the Jinshajiang suture toward the northwest and the Song Ma-Hainan suture to the southeast. It is herein proposed that latest Permian convergent margin magmatism represented by the Xin'anzhai granitoid pluton (similar to 252 Ma) terminated through the accretion of the Simao-Indochina to the South China Blocks, which marks leucogranite.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The structural evolution of the Sanandaj-Sirjan zone is the result of the convergence of the Iranian microcontinent and the Afro-Arabian continent. The study area at Khabr in the SE Sanandaj-Sirjan zone, in the hinterland of the Zagros orogen, consists of Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic rocks. In this area, deformation phases were distinguished in different rock units based on structural and stratigraphical evidence, and the deformational events are divided into two stages: (1) a Late Triassic event and (2) a Late Cretaceous to Miocene event. The Late Triassic deformation event caused regional metamorphism in the Paleozoic units. These units are overlain by unmetamorphosed Jurassic clastic sequences. Fabrics and structural evidence confirm that the F-1 folding recumbent and refolded folds were synchronous with the metamorphism of the Paleozoic units and terminated in the Early Jurassic. The time table of the orogenic phases shows that this deformation event is related to the Cimmerian orogenic phase. From a geodynamic point of view, the early Cimmerian deformation in the southeastern Iranian margin suggests that the SE Sanandaj-Sirjan zone was an active margin at that time. The early Cimmerian discordance recorded the onset of a contractional component related to the oblique subduction of Neo-Tethys beneath the central Iranian microcontinent. Structures related to the Late Cretaceous to Miocene deformation phase are observed in Jurassic to Oligocene units, which contain moderately inclined and plunging folds. Comparing these folds with domains of deformation generated in models of transpression shows that the folding was caused by a combination of contractional and dip-slip components of movement, eventually resulting in the formation of a thrust system. The Khabr thrust systems consist of five sheets of oblique thrusts, duplex structures and shear zones. The shear zones generally strike E-W and dip moderately N (30A degrees-40A degrees). The occurrence of asymmetric folds with hinges that are either parallel to strike or plunge down dip demonstrates an oblique-slip component in these thrust shear zones. The stretching lineation in the mylonites within the shear zones is defined by the long axes of ellipsoidal grains of quartz, calcite, plagioclase and garnet. In general, stretching lineations trend from N40A degrees W to N80A degrees W with an intermediate (35A degrees) plunge. The geometry of foliation and lineation within these shear zones shows the effect of dip- and oblique-slip shearing. Deformation continued with strike-slip faulting becoming important during the last stages of deformation from the Miocene to the present day. The results of this study demonstrate that the evolution of the SE Sanandaj-Sirjan zone, from Late Triassic to Miocene, is compatible with an inclined dextral transpression along this zone.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Makeng Fe deposit is located in the southwestern Fujian district, South China. The Sm-Nd isochron ages of seven samples of pure garnet and five of pure magnetite separates from the Makeng ores yielded an isochron age of 157 +/- A 15 Ma. Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) zircon U-Pb dating of the nearby exposed the Dayang-Juzhou (DJ) porphyritic biotite granite and fine-grained syenogranite yielded Pb-206/U-238 ages of 140.2 +/- A 1.1 and 140.1 +/- A 1.0 Ma, respectively. These results suggest that the intrusion of the DJ granite and the Makeng skarn alterations and Fe mineralization are contemporaneous. The DJ granite exhibits geochemical characteristics of A-type granites, including high values of Na2O + K2O (8.13-8.92 wt%), FeOt/MgO (3.4-21.5), and Ga/Al (2.64-3.45 x 10(-4)), and low Al2O3 (10.71-13.29 wt%) value. Chondrite-normalized rare earth element patterns are characterized by obviously negative Eu anomalies (delta Eu = 0.02-0.28) and primitive-mantle normalized spidergrams show the enrichment in high field strength element and depleting in Sr, Ti, Ba, and Eu. The geochemical characteristics of DJ granite suggest that the granite was derived from partial melting of the Paleoproterozoic metasedimentary rocks of the Cathaysia basement. And some underplating of mafic magma in the lower tholeiitic crust and/or depleted mantle might be involved and provide the heat source for the partial melting. The DJ granite also fits the spatiotemporal distribution of the Jurassic-Cretaceous coastward migration of both extensional and arc-related magmatism and fills the A-type granites gap in the early stage of the early Cretaceous (145-125 Ma). Therefore, it is suggested that the late Jurassic and early Cretaceous magmatism in southwestern Fujian district were generated in an extensional environment responding to the slab rollback and concomitant retreating arc system of the paleo-Pacific plate within the South China Block. And the Fe metallogeny in southwestern Fujian district is genetically linked with the magmatism during this period.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Based on an N-S-oriented crustal-scale cross section running east of the Rhine Valley in Vorarlberg, western Austria, we address the Alpine nappe stack and discuss the boundary between Central and Eastern Alps. For our cross section, we used surface geology, drillings and reinterpreted seismic lines, together with published sections. The general architecture of the examined area can be described as a typical foreland fold-and-thrust belt, comprising the tectonic units of the Subalpine Molasse, (Ultra-)Helvetic, Penninic and Austroalpine nappes. These units overthrusted the autochthonous Molasse along the south-dipping listric Alpine basal thrust. The European Basement, together with its autochthonous cover, dips gently towards the south and is dissected by normal faults and trough structures. The seismic data clearly show an offset not only of the top of the European Basement, but also of the Mesozoic cover and the Lower Marine Molasse. This indicates an activity of the structures as normal faults after the sedimentation of the Lower Marine Molasse. The Subalpine Molasse is multiply stacked, forming a triangle zone at the boundary with the foreland Molasse. The shortening within the Subalpine Molasse amounts to approximately 45 km (similar to 67 %), as deduced from our cross section with the Lower Marine Molasse as a reference. The hinterland-dipping duplex structure of the Helvetic nappes is deduced from surface and borehole data. There are at least two Helvetic nappes needed to fill the available space between the Molasse below and the Northpenninic above. This is in line with the westerly located NRP20-East transect (Schmid et al., Tectonics 15(5):1047-1048, 1996; Schmid et al., The TRANSMED Atlas: the Mediterranean Region from Crust to Mantle, 2004), where the two Helvetic nappes are separated by the Santis thrust. Yet in contrast to the Helvetic nappes in the NRP20-East transect, both of our Helvetic nappes comprise Cretaceous and Jurassic strata. This change is explained by an eastward down-stepping of the Santis thrust along a pre-existing, approximately N-S striking lateral ramp bounding an inverted Jurassic graben structure below the Rhine Valley. This causes the Santis thrust to detach the base Cretaceous west of the Rhine Valley and the base Jurassic units east of it. This graben-controlled change in detachment level leads to the formation of quite different nappe stacks on either side of the Rhine Valley and a "fault-controlled" appearance of the boundary between the Central and Eastern Alps.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Teisseyre-Tornquist Zone (TTZ) corresponds to a crustal boundary between the Precambrian East European Platform (EEP) and the Palaeozoic West European Platform. Although the zone has been controlling Phanerozoic evolution of large parts of Central Europe, its course, geometry and origin are still poorly constrained. Deep reflection seismic profile POLCRUST-01, recently acquired in SE Poland, for the first time allowed a precise comparison of the Ediacaran and later tectonic patterns to the deep crustal features of the TTZ and adjacent areas. The TTZ corresponds to the subvertical Tomaszw Fault separating the Radom-KraA &gt; nik Elevation, composed of the typical EEP crust, from the Bigoraj-Narol Block (BNB) in the SW, with a thinned crystalline basement showing affinities to the EEP crust. The BNB is a part of the larger Caledonian Aysogry Terrane as evidenced by its Lower Palaeozoic stratigraphy and gravity data. Thus, for the first time, the proximal Baltican affinity of this unit has been documented unambiguously. The Aysogry Terrane is delimited from the SW by the subvertical Cieszanw Fault Zone, corresponding to the Holy Cross Suture. The adjacent Maopolska Terrane is characterized by a distinct Early Palaeozoic stratigraphy, and lower-middle crust exhibiting SW-dipping reflective packages interpreted as NE-verging thrust and shear zones of a Neoproterozoic orogen. The observations from the POLCRUST-01 profile and regional comparisons indicate that the TTZ is a major Caledonian transcurrent zone between Poland and East Romania. In central Poland, the TTZ likely forms a narrow subvertical contact between the EEP and a proximal Kuiavia Terrane, as constrained by the deep refraction seismic data. To the NW, the zone extends towards the Pomeranian part of the Caledonide fold-and-thrust belt related to the Avalonia-Baltica collision zone (Thor Suture). South-east of Poland the TTZ corresponds to the Rava Ruska Fault Zone established as a Caledonian suture separating adjacent terrane, probably of a Baltican affinity. The East Romanian part of the TTZ conforms with the SfA cent ntu Gheorghe Fault separating reworked EEP crust of the Pre-Dobrogean Depression from the North Dobrogea unit bearing a strong Variscan and Cimmerian overprint.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Detrital heavy mineral analysis coupled with a regional geological review provide key elements to re-evaluate the distribution of the Rhodope metamorphic zone (SE Europe) in the region and its role in determining the evolution of the Thrace basin. We focus on the Eocene-Oligocene sedimentary successions exposed in the southern Thrace basin margin to determine the dispersal pathways of eroded crustal elements, of both oceanic and continental origins, as well as their different contributions through time. Lithological aspects and tectonic data coupled with geochemistry and geochronology of metamorphic terranes exposed in the area point to a common origin of tectonic units exposed in NW Turkey (Biga Peninsula) with those of NE Greece and SE Bulgaria (Rhodope region). The entire region displays (1) common extensional signatures, consisting of comparable granitoid intrusion ages, and a NE-SW sense of shear (2) matching zircon age populations between the metapelitic and metamafic rocks of the Circum-Rhodope Belt (NE Greece) and those of the Camlica-Kemer complex and Cetmi m,lange exposed in NW Turkey. Detrital heavy mineral abundances from Eocene-Oligocene sandstones of the southern Thrace basin demonstrate the influence of two main sediment sources mostly of ultramafic/ophiolitic and low- to medium-grade metamorphic lithologies, plus a third, volcanic source limited to the late Eocene-Oligocene. Detrital Cr-spinel chemistry is used to understand the origin of the ultramafic material and to discriminate the numerous ultramafic sources exposed in the region. Compositional and stratigraphic data indicate a major influence of the metapelitic source in the eastern part (Gallipoli Peninsula) during the initial stages of sedimentation with increasing contributions from metamafic sources through time. On the other hand, the western and more external part of the southern Thrace margin (Gok double dagger eada, Samothraki and Limnos) displays compositional signatures according to a mixed provenance from the metapelitic and metamafic sources of the Circum-Rhodope Belt (CamlA +/- ca-Kemer complex and Cetmi m,lange). Tectonic restoration and compositional signatures provide constraints on the Palaeogene palaeogeography of this sector of the central-eastern Mediterranean region.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Elephant Island, located in the vicinity of the present-day active boundary of the South Shetland Block and the Antarctic and Scotia plates, is a region of particular interest for understanding the past and present geodynamic evolution of the southern Scotia Arc. Lineament from different data sources, field-measured fractures and geomorphological evidences have been analysed in this context. The lineaments extracted from aerial photographs (1,624), from a DEM (348) and from RADARSAT-2 satellite data (1,365) indicate four dominant lineament sets with NE-SW, NW-SE, N-S and W-E strikes. All data sources identified similar lineament families, but differences in the frequency distributions and subsequently on the dominant orientations were observed. The measurements direct of fractures were obtained from 23 sites in the field at which 278 planes were measured. Fracture planes indicate main modes trending in the NNE-SSW and NNW-SSE directions and a secondary mode in the E-W. The major trends of the fracture measurements and the lineaments display a good correlation in the E-W direction. However, there is an angular variation in the azimuth values of the NNE-SSE and NNW-SSE fractures with respect to the N-S, NE-SW and NW-SE orientations of the lineaments of approximately 20A degrees. This trend deviation may be due to the fact that mapped lineaments are composed of small fracture sets that may be related to shear fractures that cannot be distinguished at the aerial photograph or radar satellite data scales. Submerged sea-floor morphological feature orientations match the studied morphostructures on the island and the main tectonic structures in this part of the Scotia Arc. A linkage of the main lineament families to the tectonic stages from the Oligocene to the present has been proposed, taking into account the information of the orientation and sense of movement of the fractures and stresses in the Elephant Island region.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The evolution of drainage systems in and around active orogens may be strongly affected by climatic or tectonic processes. Information on the drainage evolution is stored in the sediments of the foreland depocentres. We investigated the provenance of two key deposits adjacent to the Central Alps, the Pliocene Sundgau gravels and the Pleistocene Hohere Deckenschotter by applying detrital thermochronology. Combined with provenance information from Rhine Graben deposits, we propose a reconstruction of the north Alpine drainage system since the middle Pliocene and discuss potential controlling mechanisms. Our data show that the Rhine Graben received detritus from the Alpine realm already during the Pliocene, indicating two different river systems-the proto-Rhine and the Aare-Doubs-draining the Alpine realm toward the North Sea and Mediterranean Sea. The investigated sediments contain detritus from two central Alpine sources, one showing a regional exhumational equilibrium and the other characterized by increasing exhumation rates. Discharge of the latter source ceased after similar to 2 Ma, reflecting a northward shift of the main Alpine drainage divide. Between similar to 2.0 and 1.2 Ma, the drainage system was affected by a major change, which we explain as resulting from a change in the Alpine stress field leading to tectonic exhumation and topography reduction in the area of the southern Aar massif. Generally, it seems that between similar to 4 and 1.2 Ma, the drainage system was mainly controlled by tectonic processes, despite first glaciations that already affected the north-Alpine foreland by similar to 2 Ma. The drainage system only seems to have reacted to the late Cenozoic climate changes after similar to 1.2 Ma, i.e., at the time of the most intense Alpine glaciation. At that time, the course of the Rhine River shifted toward the area of the Hegau volcanics, and the size of the Rhine River catchment became strongly reduced.</td>

The structure in general is 2-D and the average strike is N60 degrees W. 2-D inversions using TE + TM and TE + TM + Tzy were carried out Both inversions derived models with similar features but with modified shape. The TE + TM + Tzy inversion brings up two conducting zones enveloping three anomalous conducting bodies. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) analysis of the samples collected from 8 to 10 m pit from different stratigraphic units of Dalma volcano-sedimentary belt indicates the presence of gold, silver, uranium and copper. The study area is a felsic dominated rifted margin and shows high conductivity contrast along with high gravity, magnetic and significant radiometric anomaly. Thus, the conducting zones indicate the presence of volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) or volcano hosted gold deposit (Au-VMS) in NSMB. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In a long and distinguished career, George Plafker made fundamental advances in understanding of megathrust tectonics, tsunami generation, paleoseismology, crustal neotectonics, and Alaskan geology, chiefly by means of geological field observations. George discovered that giant earthquakes result from tens of meters of seismic slip on subduction megathrusts, and he did this before the theory of plate tectonics had become a paradigm. The discovery was founded on George's comprehensive mapping of land-level changes in the aftermath of the 1964 earthquake in Alaska, and on his follow-up mapping, in 1968, in the region of the 1960 earthquakes in Chile. The mapping showed paired, parallel belts of coseismic uplift largely offshore and coseismic subsidence mostly onshore a pattern now familiar as the initial condition assumed in simulations of subduction-zone tsunamis. George recognized, moreover, that splay faulting can play a major role in tsunami generation, and he also distinguished carefully between tectonic and landslide sources for the multiple tsunamis that accounted for nearly all the fatalities associated with the 1964 Alaska earthquake. George's classic monographs on the 1964 earthquake include findings on subduction-zone paleoseismology that he soon extended to include stratigraphic evidence for cyclic vertical deformation at the Copper River Delta, as well as recurrent uplift evidenced by flights of marine terraces at Middleton Island. As a geologist of earthquakes, George also clarified the tectonics and hazards of crustal faulting in Alaska, California, and other areas worldwide. All the while, George was mapping bedrock geology in Alaska, where he contributed importantly to today's understanding of how terranes were accreted and modified. Especially important was his documentation of the origin, movement, subduction, and collision of the Yakutat terrane in southern Alaska. Published by Elsevier Ltd.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Megafan conglomerates of foreland basins chronicle the combined effect of palaeoclimate conditions, tectonic processes and the flux and granulometric composition of the supplied sediment. However, the architecture of these deposits is seldom uniquely compatible with a single driving force. This problem is illustrated here with a field-based analysis of the ca. 30-20Ma-old Napf deposits in the north Alpine foreland basin which are coeval with a substantial global warming of ca. 6 degrees C during the Late Oligocene. The observed larger grain sizes and a change in fluvial style from wandering to braided could be explained climatically by a shift to drier conditions with sparse vegetation, but would have resulted in less than 400m of additional accommodation space during the 1Ma duration of change. Accordingly, a climate scenario alone is also not compatible with rapid sediment accumulation rates of &gt;1000mMa(-1) recorded at Napf, or with a lack of any remarkable shifts in the Froude number, which would be expected if water discharge patterns changed substantially. Alternatively, flexural downwarping in response to a tectonic pulse could account for the increase in grain size and the change in fluvial style from wandering (more distal facies) to braided (proximal equivalent). However, a third driving force is required to explain the contemporaneous backstepping of the distal gravel front and progradation of the proximal braided facies. We suggest that the erosional hinterland steepened in response to an inferred tectonic pulse, resulting in a more widespread exposure of lithologies with higher erosional resistance, as inferred from an increasing contribution of crystalline constituents in the clast suites. Such a change would result in a larger D-50 and a higher clast size variability in the supplied sediment, which in turn would contribute to the observed change from wandering to braided and the related shift in depositional systems. This study highlights the importance of tectonic processes and the role of changing surface lithologies in the source area for explaining variations in megafan construction even in the light of substantial palaeoclimate shift.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Competing geodynamic models, such as rigid-block extrusion, continuous deformation, and the mid-lower crustal flow, have been proposed to describe the growth and expansion of eastern Tibet. However, the dynamic processes responsible for plateau evolution and deformation remain poorly understood partly due to resolution limitations of previous models of lithospheric structure. On the basis of joint inversion of Rayleigh wave dispersion and receiver functions using data from a newly deployed seismic array, we have obtained a high-resolution 3D image that reveals the distribution of low-velocity zones (LVZs) with unprecedented clarity. The prominent feature of our model is two low-velocity channels that bound major strike-slip faults in SE Tibet and wrap around the Eastern Himalaya Syntaxis, consistent with the clockwise movement of crustal material in this region. Most large earthquakes in this region occurred in the boundaries of the LVZs. We propose that ductile flow within these channels, in addition to shear motion along strike-slip faults, played a significant role in accommodating intensive lithospheric deformation during the eastward expansion of Tibet in the Cenozoic.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Himalayan orogen provides a type example on which a number of models of the causes and consequences of crustal deformation are based and it has been suggested that it is the site of a variety of feedbacks between tectonics and erosion. Within the broader orogen, fluvial drainages partly reflect surface uplift, different climatic zones and a response to crustal deformation. In the eastern Himalaya, the unusual drainage configuration of the Yarlung Tsangpo-Brahmaputra River has been interpreted either as antecedent drainage distorted by the India-Asia collision (and as such applied as a passive strain marker of lateral extrusion), latest Neogene tectonically-induced river capture, or glacial damming-induced river diversion events.
   <br>Here we apply a multi-technique approach to the Neogene paleo-Brahmaputra deposits of the Surma Basin (Bengal Basin, Bangladesh) to test the long-debated occurrence and timing of river capture of the Yarlung Tsangpo by the Brahmaputra River. We provide U-Pb detrital zircon and rutile, isotopic (Sr-Nd and Hf) and petrographic evidence consistent with river capture of the Yarlung Tsangpo by the Brahmaputra River in the Early Miocene. We document influx of Cretaceous-Paleogene zircons in Early Miocene sediments of the paleo-Brahmaputra River that we interpret as first influx of material from the Asian plate (Transhimalayan arc) indicative of Yarlung Tsangpo contribution. Prior to capture, the predominantly Precambrian-Paleozoic zircons indicate that only the Indian plate was drained. Contemporaneous with Transhimalayan influx reflecting the river capture, we record arrival of detrital material affected by Cenozoic metamorphism, as indicated by rutiles and zircons with Cenozoic U-Pb ages and an increase in metamorphic grade of detritus as recorded by petrography. We interpret this as due to a progressively increasing contribution from the erosion of the metamorphosed core of the orogen. Whole rock Sr-Nd isotopic data from the same samples provide further support to this interpretation. River capture may have been caused by a change in relative base level due to uplift of the Tibetan plateau. Assuming such river capture occurred via the Siang River in the Early Miocene, we refute the "tectonic aneurysm" model of tectonic-erosion coupling between river capture and rapid exhumation of the eastern syntaxis, since a time interval of at least 10 Ma between these two events is now demonstrated. This work is also the first to highlight U-Pb dating on detrital rutile as a powerful approach in provenance studies in the Himalaya in combination with zircon U-Pb chronology. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In steady-state orogens, topographic gradients are expected to increase with elevation whereas the European Alps feature a transition from increasing to decreasing slopes. This peculiar pattern has been interpreted to reflect either the critical slope stability angle or a premature fluvial landscape but is also consistent with the glacial buzz-saw hypothesis. To disentangle the contributions of each of these principles we split the Alps into contiguous domains of structural units and analyze their slope-elevation distributions emphasizing glaciated and non-glaciated realms. In comparable structural units within the extent of the last glacial maximum (LGM) the transition from increasing to decreasing slopes is located at the equilibrium line altitude (ELA) of the LGM and we interpret this to be evidence for the impact of glacial erosion. Decay rates of glacial landforms towards steady-state slopes depend on lithological properties leading to a landscape characterized by different transient states. Beyond the LGM limits the slope-elevation distributions show local maxima as well, but these are located at varying altitudes implying a tectonic driver. This observation and data from surrounding basins suggests that at least parts of the European Alps experienced a pre-Pleistocene pulse of tectonic uplift. The resulting presence of premature low-gradient terrain above the ELA during the global cooling in Plio-Pleistocene times would have heavily influenced the onset and the extent of an alpine ice cap.

The cores intersect one of the thickest continuous accumulations of Plio-Pleistocene fluvial sediments in western Central Europe. The resultant magnetic polarity stratigraphy includes every Quaternary polarity chron, thereby providing constant age constraint down to the Gauss-Matuyama Boundary (2.58 Ma). Older deposits cannot be unequivocally dated; instead, various age-depth models are discussed. We base our chronostratigraphic interpretation of the successions tentatively on three assumptions. A) The accommodation was almost constant overtime. B) Hiatuses in the duration of subchrons (on the order of 0.2 Myr) may occur, and the actual step-like age-depth relationship is best depicted as a smooth curve with almost constant slope. C) Long chrons and subchrons have a higher preservation potential than shorter polarity intervals.
   <br>The stratigraphic scenarios with the highest probability - based upon our three assumptions - lead to minimum ages of &gt;5.235 Ma and &gt;4.187 Ma for the oldest parts of the Viernheim and Heidelberg cores, respectively. Consequently, this study provides the first consistent magnetic polarity stratigraphy for quasi-continuous sequences of late Neogene to Quaternary fluvial sediments in the Rhine Basin and generally in western central Europe. This methodologically independent chronostratigraphy supplies an urgently required temporal model for on-going tectonic and sedimentological studies and the reconstruction of the palaeoclimate since the Pliocene in this part of Europe.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>A comparative study of the central and southern parts of the Palaeoproterozoic Svecofennian orogen in the Baltic/Fennoscandian Shield and the platform area to the east and south of the Baltic Sea indicates that at least these parts of the orogen are built up of several NW-SE trending, 100-300 km wide tectonic megadomains separated from each other and complicated by major zones of mostly dextral shearing. The generation of these zones occurred successively between 1.86 and 1.75 Ga, concomitantly with continuing crustal accretion younging towards the southwest. Even considering the distorting presence of a number of microcontinents, this indicates the one-time existence and repeated episodic activity of a master subduction zone stepwise falling back to the present south-southwest. At 1.82-1.80 Ga, the oblique collision of protocontinents Volgo-Sarmatia and Fennoscandia interfered with the accretionary growth of the crust in the Svecofennian orogen. In the west, the system of Svecofennian tectonic domains and shear zones is delimited by 1.70-1.55 Ga orogenic belts marking the Laurentia-Greenland-Baltica margin of Columbia. Altogether, the available U-Pb zircon datings and studies of key rocks and structures in the South Baltic region allow more detailed Trans-Baltic correlation and the creation of new integrated models of the structural and tectonic evolution of the Svecofennian orogen in particular and northern Europe in general. The new findings will be important also in the continuing study of supercontinent formation and supercontinent cycles, and the drifting of Palaeoproterozoic protocontinents during the assembly of Columbia/Nuna.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The southern part of the Baltic Shield hosts a series of mafic dykes and sills of Mesoproterozoic ages, including a ca. 1.53-1.46 Ga sheet-like gabbro-dolerite sills and the Salmi plateau-basalts from the Lake Ladoga region. Based on chiefly geochemical data, the region is conventionally interpreted as an intracratonic Ladoga rift (graben). We question the validity of this geodynamic interpretation by analyzing regional geophysical data (crustal structure, heat flow, Bouguer gravity anomalies, magnetic anomalies, and mantle Vs velocities). We provide a complete list of tectonic, magmatic, and geophysical characteristics typical of continental rifts in general and demonstrate that, except for magmatic and, perhaps, some gravity signature, the Lake Ladoga region lacks any other rift features. We also compare the geophysical data from the Lake Ladoga region with similar in age Midcontinent and Valday rifts, and provide alternative explanations for Mesoproterozoic geodynamic evolution of the southern Baltic Shield. We propose that Mesoproterozoic mafic intrusions in southern Fennoscandia may be associated with a complex deformation pattern during reconfiguration of (a part of) Nuna (Columbia) supercontinent, which led to magma intrusions as a series of mafic dykes along lithosphere weakness zones and ponding of small magma pockets within the cratonic lithosphere. Consequent magma cooling and its partial transition to eclogite facies could have led to the formation of a series of basement depressions, similar to intracratonic basins of North America, while spatially heterogeneous thermo-chemical subsidence, with phase transitions locally speeded by the presence of (subduction-related) fluids, could have produced a series of faults bounding graben-like structures.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Major- and trace-element geochemistry, Sm-Nd isotopic and U-Pb geochronological (ID TIMS, baddeleyite) data are presented for Paleoproterozoic mafic dykes in the Karelian Craton, eastern Fennoscandian shield. Mafic dyke swarms recognized in the Lake Upper Kuito area in the Western Karelian terrane of the Karelian Craton include (i) NE-trending ca. 2450 Ma gabbronorite dykes, (ii) NW-trending ca. 2310 Ma dolerite dykes, and (iii) NNW-trending ca. 2130 Ma continental MORB-type tholeiitic dykes. Each swarm belongs to a distinct intraplate igneous event and indicates specific mantle melting and extensional processes.
   <br>The ca. 2.31 Ga doleritic dykes have high-Fe, high-Ti tholeiitic series affinity and characterized by high concentrations of lithophile trace elements. The enrichment of LREE and unfractionated HREE patterns together with depletion of Nb on multi-element diagrams and initial epsilon(Nd) values of +0.5 to +0.8 are characteristic for ca. 2.31 Ga dolerites. The geochemical modelling results suggest that these features could be originated via combination of fractional crystallization and crustal contamination processes, and do not indicative of a mantle source enrichment. It also indicates long-term storage of melts in an intracrustal magma chamber and a relatively slow ascent to the surface. The primary melts of ca. 2.31 Ga dolerites possibly originated by partial melting of a DM-type mantle source in the spinel peridotite stability field.
   <br>In contrast to previous ca. 2.45 Ga event studied ca. 2.31 Ga dolerites do not indicate high-temperature mantle-plume induced mantle melting. On the other hand, the ca. 2.31 Ga dykes have some similarities with syn-breakup ca. 2.13 Ga continental MORB-type tholeiites, although there is no evidence for the break-up of the continental lithosphere of the Karelian Craton at ca. 2.31 Ga. Thus ca. 2.31 Ga dykes could indicate the existence of relatively stable extensional tectonic environment and an unsuccessful attempt of break-up of the continent.
   <br>The ca. 2.31 Ga dykes together with previously studied Runkaus basalts and Taivalkoski dykes could be considered as a component of distinct relatively wide-spread Kuito-Taivalkoski igneous event within the ca. 2.2-2.4 Ga "crustal age gap" period in the eastern Fennoscandian shield. This probably indicate that the number and intensity of endogenous events of age 2.4-2.2 Ga are greatly undervalued. This also argues against a decrease of endogenic activity and magmatic "slowdown" during ca. 2.4-2.2 Ga period. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Mesoproterozoic-Neoproterozoic sedimentary succession of the eastern part of the Siberian Craton consists of several unconformity-bounded, kilometer-scale siliciclastic-carbonate cycles. The overlying Lower Cambrian rocks are often compositionally similar to the uppermost units of the Neoproterozoic succession.
   <br>Twenty-nine samples were collected for U-Pb detrital zircon study and 27 samples were analyzed for whole-rock Sm-Nd isotopes. In total, 1491 detrital zircon grains were dated and 1148 grains were selected for provenance interpretation. Samples from the Uchur and Aimchan groups only contain detrital zircons of Paleoproterozoic and Archean age. Samples from the Kerpyl Group located on the Siberian Craton contain Paleoproterozoic and Archean grains as well, but samples from the Kerpyl Group in the Sette-Daban Ridge have significant numbers of Mesoproterozoic detrital zircons. Mesoproterozoic detrital zircons predominate in samples from the Uy Group. In the northern part of the study area, samples from the uppermost Neoproterozoic and Lower Cambrian strata contain numerous ca. 790-590 Ma detrital zircons, whereas in the southern part of the study area only Paleoproterozoic and Archean grains have been found. The whole-rock Sm-Nd isotopic values of clastic rocks show that most samples have isotopic signatures typical for the Siberian Craton basement, whereas some samples from the Kerpyl Group and younger rock units have isotopic signatures typical of the Grenville Orogen.
   <br>Most of the Archean and Paleoproterozoic detrital zircons were eroded from the basement of the Siberian Craton, although some ca. 2080-2030 Ma detrital zircons are likely to have a non-Siberian provenance. However, rocks younger than ca. 1700 Ma are not known in the Siberian Craton basement and all Mesoproterozoic and younger grains must therefore have a non-Siberian provenance.
   <br>The detrital zircon age distributions and whole-rock Nd isotopic signatures of many samples from the Kerpyl Group and younger units are very close to those of the Grenville Orogen in North America, suggesting that erosion of the latter contributed to clastic deposition along the Siberian margin. Three paleocontinental restorations proposed by Sears and Price (1978, 2003), Rainbird et al. (1998) and Pisarevsky and Natapov (2003) are invoked to explain the occurrence of Grenville-age detrital zircons in the Siberian sedimentary succession. The provenance of ca. 790-590 Ma detrital zircons is most likely to be located within the Central Taimyr accretionary belt formed along the northern margin of the Siberian Craton in the Neoproterozoic.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This paper is a summary of the geological and geophysical information available today on the tectonics of the Arctic continental structures in the Late Precambrian-Paleozoic. We propose a new outlook on the history of Arctida - a continental mass that combined sialic blocks of the current Eurasian shelf of the Arctic Ocean. Based on new materials including paleomagnetic data we present a series of paleotectonic reconstructions that reflect the main evolutionary stages and mechanisms of the structure of Arctida from the Early Neoproterozoic to the Mesozoic. We demonstrate the role of the continental blocks of the Arctic in the global drift of lithospheric plates from the breakup of Rodinia to the assembly of Pangea. From the presented model we propose the existence of two (!) Arctic subcontinents in the Neoproterozoic-Paleozoic history of the Earth. Arctida-I was a collage of ancient blocks of Arctic sialic crust within Rodinia in the junction zone between the Laurentia, Siberia and Baltica cratons. During the breakup of Rodinia this subcontinent was destroyed with the formation of a series of small continental plates such as Kara, Svalbard and, probably, the New Siberian Islands (NSI), which is usually regarded as part of the Chukchi-Alaska composite terrane. By the time of its breakup Arctida-I was in a subequatorial position. The post-rifting tectonics of the newly formed small plates was closely associated with strike-slips that played a defining role both at the stages of opening and closure of the Paleozoic oceans. The rebirth of Arctida was due to the assembly of Pangea at the Paleozoic-Mesozoic limit. We consider Arctida-II a newly formed subcontinent that composed the shelf margin of Pangea in the temperate latitudes of the northern hemisphere, and again connected the margins of Laurentia, Baltica and Siberia.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>New mapping and age data from rocks of the West African Craton and its western margin, as well as a review of published age data for the region indicate that the southwestern margin of the craton is composed of an Archaean basement of TTG gneisses and granitoid rocks that formed over a long period of time between 3.54 and 2.64 Ga. The age data refute the previously held notion of two craton-forming events, the similar to 3.0 Ga Leonian and similar to 2.7 Ga Liberian cycles, but instead indicate a pulse at similar to 3.4 Ga, followed by near-continuous crustal growth between similar to 3.05 and 2.64 Ga. Age data for the Kenema Assemblage, a strip of Archaean rocks separated from the main Archaean exposure further east by Neoproterozoic cover, suggest that this represents a tectonic window.
   <br>To the west of the Archaean craton, the Rokel-Kasila Belt occurs, which incorporates two tectonic terranes: the Palaeoproterozoic Kasila terrane, accreted to the Archaean craton and comprised of granulite-facies paragneiss units of the Kasila Group, and the Meso- to Neoproterozoic Marampa terrane, thrust on top of the Archaean basement, and comprised of greenschist-facies schists and metabasites of the Marampa Group. A metavolcanic unit in the Kasila Group provides an age of 1941 +/- 4 Ma interpreted to date the emplacement of the Kasila succession. Xenocrystic zircon in the sample suggest the presence of cryptic older crust with components of 2.7-2.6 Ga and 2.2 Ga, and the Kasila Terrane is interpreted to represent a Ganderian-type peri-Gondwanan terrane left attached to the West African Craton. Detrital age data on two schist units of the Marampa Group suggest a maximum age of deposition of between 1076-1030 Ma. The detrital age peaks indicate source terranes in part consistent with a West African affinity, but also comprising significant sources of between 2.0 and 1.0 Ga for which no suitable source terranes are known in West Africa. We suggest that at the time the Marampa Group was deposited along the West African margin at similar to 1.05 Ga, a source terrane with significant matching components of Palaeo-proterozoic and Mesoproterozoic source rocks, was present to provide the sedimentary input, possibly the Amazonian Craton.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>We present results from a paleomagnetic study of the previously undated Erayinia dykes intruding the south-western Yilgarn Craton. The U-Pb TIMs baddeleyite age of these dykes is now 2401 +/- 1 Ma, which is about 10 m.y. younger than the 2418-2410 Ma Widgiemooltha dyke swarm. The paleomagnetic study isolated a stable primary remanence with steep downward direction, and the paleomagnetic pole (22.7 degrees S. 150.5 degrees E, A(95) = 11.4 degrees) is similar, but not identical to that of the previously studied Widgiemooltha dykes. We interpret this difference as the result of the movement of the Yilgam Craton toward the pole at similar to 1 degrees/m.y. angular speed, which is comparable with tectonic plates' velocities during the Phanerozoic. Paleomagnetic polarities of Widgiemooltha and Erayinia dykes suggest that at least one geomagnetic reversal occurred between these two magmatic events. The estimated amplitude of geomagnetic secular variations at c. 2400 Ma is slightly higher than predicted by the existing models for the last 5 m.y. at the c. 64 degrees latitude. The paleomagnetic data and patterns of c. 2.6-2.1 Ga mafic dyke swarms permit the recently suggested reconstruction of the Paleoproterozoic supercontinent. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Using topography derived from stereo-photoclinometry, we identified flexural uplift at a rift zone suggesting elastic thickness values in the range 3.8-4.4 km. We estimate the temperature at the base of the lithosphere to be in the range 99-146 K, depending on the strain rate assumed, with corresponding heat fluxes of 28-92 mW/m(2). Neither tidal heating, assuming Ariel's current eccentricity, nor radiogenic heat production from the silicate core are enough to cause the inferred heat fluxes. None of three proposed ancient mean-motion resonances produce equilibrium tidal heating values in excess of 4.3 mW/m(2). Thus, the origin of the inferred high heat fluxes is currently mysterious.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Buffered Crater Counting (BCC) offers a possibility to determine ages of linear/curvilinear surface features that provide no or only very limited surface areas for the conventional crater counting approach. In this study we applied the BCC analysis to two tectonic fault systems, Fortuna Fossae and a subsection of Sirenum Fossae. We compared BCC results with age estimates derived from conventional crater counting on the surrounding geologic units and investigated to what extent crater ejecta blankets can be used for determining the stratigraphic placement of craters pre- or post-dating the formation of linear features. Furthermore, we introduce a new functionality of the CraterTools software for ArcGIS which allows for a user-friendly semi-automatic application of the otherwise time-consuming procedure of BCC analysis. The software provides the resulting crater size-frequency data in a standard format, which can be read and analyzed in the CraterStats analysis software.
   <br>Our case studies showed that the BCC approach provides equivalent or even more precise age results compared to the conventional stratigraphic approach. Here, we found that the investigated section of Sirenum Fossae is younger than previously thought. The derived formation age from the BCC analysis is 3.44(-0.25)(+01) Ga which corresponds to Late instead of Early Hesperian. Fortuna Fossae formed shortly after the emplacement of its now-fractured geologic host unit (Late Hesperian). Ages derived from BCC analysis vary between 3.53+M Ga and 3.50(-0.11)(+0.07) Ga. Furthermore, we recommend the use of crater ejecta blankets to position them in the stratigraphic sequence in order to improve crater statistics. However, the accuracy of the results depends on the extent and preservation state of the continuous ejecta blankets in the region of interest. Thus, the applied buffer width has to be chosen carefully according to investigated crater sizes and local observations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The San Rafael Massif is characterized by widespread fluorite and manganese epithermal ore deposits whose origin has been under debate to the present. Isotopic (Sm/Nd and K/Ar) and geochemical (trace elements and REE) data of fluorite and manganese ore allowed to establish the age and genesis of the deposits and to propose a regional genetic model. The fluorite deposits were formed during the Upper Triassic-Lower Jurassic as a result of the Triassic rifting that launched a hydrothermal activity at regional scale. The hydrothermal fluids had low T and high fO(2) with fluorine probably derived from a mantle source and REE scavenged from the volcanics of the Gondwanan Choiyoi Magmatic Cycle upper section. The manganese deposits were formed by oxidizing hydrothermal fluids that collected Mn from deep sources and also leached REE from the upper section of the Choiyoi Magmatic Cycle during two mineralization episodes. One episode was linked to the rift tectonic setting that remained active up to the Upper Cretaceous and the other was related to an Early Miocene back-arc extensional geodynamic setting. Both manganese and fluorite deposits were formed in extensional tectonic settings within an epithermal environment near the surface, and can be ascribed to the general model of detachment-related deposits.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Pingshui Cu-Zn deposit is located in the Jiangshan-Shaoxing fault zone, which marks the Neoproterozoic suture zone between the Yangtze block and Cathaysia block in South China. It contains 0.45 million tons of proven ore reserves with grades of 1.03 wt.% Cu and 1.83 wt.% Zn. This deposit is composed of stratiform, massive sulfide ore bodies, which contain more than 60 vol.% sulfide minerals. These ore bodies are hosted in altered mafic and felsic rocks (spilites and keratophyres) of the bimodal volcanic suite that makes up the Neoproterozoic Pingshui Formation. Metallic minerals include pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, tennantite, tetrahedrite and magnetite, with minor galena. Gangue minerals are quartz, sericite, chlorite, calcite, gypsum, barite and jasper. Three distinct mineralogical zones are recognized in these massive sulfide ore bodies: a distal zone composed of sphalerite + pyrite + barite (zone I); an intermediate zone characterized by a pyrite + sphalerite + chalcopyrite assemblages (zone II); and a proximal zone containing chalcopyrite + pyrite + magnetite (zone III). A thin, layer of exhalative jaspilite overlies the sulfide ore bodies except in the proximal zone. The volcanic rocks of the Pingshui Formation are all highly altered spilites and keratophyres, but their trace element geochemistry suggests that they were generated by partial melting of the depleted mantle in an island arc setting. Homogenization temperatures of the primary fluid inclusions in quartz from massive sulfide ores are between 217 and 328 degrees C, and their salinities range from 3.2 to 5.7 wt.% NaCl equivalent. Raman spectroscopy of the fluid inclusions showed that water is the dominant component, with no other volatile components. Fluid inclusion data suggest that the ore-forming fluids were derived from circulating seawater. The delta S-34 values of pyrite from the massive sulfide ores range from -3.6%. to + 3.4%., indicating that the sulfur was primarily leached from the arc volcanic rocks of the Pingshui Formation. Both pyrite from the massive sulfide ores and plagioclase from the spilites have similar lead isotope compositions, implying that the lead was also derived from the Pingshui Formation. The low lead contents of the massive sulfide ores and the geochemistry of their host rocks are similar to many VMS Cu-Zn deposits in Canada (e.g., Noranda) and thus can be classified as belonging to the bimodal-mafic subtype. The presence of magnetite and the absence of jaspilite and barite at the -505 m level in the Pingshui deposit suggest that this level is most likely the central zone of the original lateral massive sulfide ore bodies. If this interpretation is correct, the deep part of the Pingshui Cu-Zn deposit may have significant exploration potential. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In models for strain-partitioning at obliquely-convergent plate boundaries, trench-parallel slip occurs on a vertical fault. Trench-parallel slip at the Nankai subduction zone, SW Japan, is mapped along the Median Tectonic Line (MTL) which dips approximately 40 degrees N. To understand its structural context and how the MTL functions in this slip-partitioned system, we collected a set of three seismic profiles in the Kii peninsula south of Osaka, using a multi-scale acquisition strategy that provides increasingly fine resolution. To understand its fault kinematics, we analyzed microseismic activity in two locations on the fault, using source data from Japan's Hi-net monitoring network. Structural details suggest that the MTL functioned as a megathrust during subduction of the Cretaceous Sanbagawa HP metamorphic belt. Its current pattern of microseismicity shows that it behaves as a strike-slip fault with no indication of a vertical fault at or around its surface trace. Thus, trench-parallel slip at the Nankai is now accommodated on an inclined fault plane in an unusual form of partitioning. This system appears to have developed out of a two-phase tectonic history in which a thrust structure that formed under initial-phase compressive stresses has been reactivated as a strike-slip fault under subsequent-phase shear stresses. Its unusual kinematics show that shear failure can occur on an existing non-vertical fault plane at a regional scale in preference to the rupture of a new ideal (vertical) fault plane.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Tian Shan range is an inherited intracontinental structure reactivated by the far-field effects of the India-Asia collision. A growing body of thermochronology and magnetostratigraphy datasets shows that the range grew through several tectonic pulses since similar to 25 Ma, however the early Cenozoic history remains poorly constrained. The time-lag between the Eocene India-Asia collision and the Miocene onset of Tian Shan exhumation is particularly enigmatic. This peculiar period is potentially recorded along the southwestern Tian Shan piedmont. There, late Eocene marine deposits of the proto-Paratethys epicontinental sea transition to continental foreland basin sediments of unknown age were recently dated. We provide magnetostratigraphic dating of these continental sediments from the 1700-m-thick Mine section integrated with previously published detrital apatite fission track and U/Pb zircon ages. The most likely correlation to the geomagnetic polarity time scale indicates an age span from 20.8 to 13.3 Ma with a marked increase in accumulation rates at 19-18 Ma. This implies that the entire Oligocene period is missing between the last marine and first continental sediments, as suggested by previous southwestern Tian Shan results. This differs from the southwestern Tarim basin where Eocene marine deposits are continuously overlain by late Eocene-Oligocene continental sediments. This supports a simple evolution model of the western Tarim basin with Eocene-Oligocene foreland basin activation to the south related to northward thrusting of the Kunlun Shan, followed by early Miocene activation of northern foreland basin related to overthrusting of the south Tian Shan. Our data also support southward propagation of the Tian Shan piedmont from 20 to 18 Ma that may relate to motion on the Talas Fergana Fault. The coeval activation of a major right-lateral strike-slip system allowing indentation of the Pamir Salient into the Tarim basin, suggests far-field deformation from the India-Asia collision zone affected the Tian Shan and the Talas Fergana fault by early Miocene.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The southern Qinling-Dabieshan foreland fold-thrust belt is a key region in which to investigate the continental-continental collision between North China and South China. We provide structural evidence of a diachronous dextral strike-slip thrusting deformation from the Middle Triassic in the east to the late Late Triassic in the west, which indicates a northwestward oblique subduction and suturing of the South China plate under the North China-Qinling-Dabieshan plate. We also identify a later phase of intracontinental deformation that included an orthogonal intracontinental collision and south-vergent thrusting during the Early and Middle Jurassic, indentation of South China into the Qinling-Dabieshan Orogen and arc-shaped extrusions of the southern Qinling-Dabieshan foreland fold-thrust belt from the Late Jurassic to the Cretaceous. Our results reveal that the long-term intracontinental collision rotated clockwise in a northwest-southeast-vergent direction in the Late Triassic to northeast-east-southwest-west-vergent in the Late Cretaceous. This collision may have been driven by a north-vergent subduction of the Meso-Tethys Ocean in the south, west-vergent subduction of the Izanagi plate in the east, and south-vergent compression of the Eurasia plate in the north.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Much research has been devoted to the development of numerical models of river incision. In settings where bedrock channel erosion prevails, numerous studies have used field data to calibrate the widely acknowledged stream power model of incision and to discuss the impact of variables that do not appear explicitly in the model's simplest form. However, most studies have been conducted in areas of active tectonics, displaying a clear geomorphic response to the tectonic signal. Here, we analyze the traces left in the drainage network 0.7 My after the Ardennes region (western Europe) underwent a moderate 100-150 m uplift. We identify a set of knickpoints that have traveled far upstream in the Ourthe catchment, following this tectonic perturbation. Using a misfit function based on time residuals, our best fit of the stream power model parameters yields m=0.75 and K=4.63x10(-8) m(-0.5)y(-1). Linear regression of the model time residuals against quantitative expressions of bedrock resistance to erosion shows that this variable does not correlate significantly with the residuals. By contrast, proxies for position in the drainage system prove to be able to explain 76% of the residual variance. High time residuals correlate with knickpoint position in small tributaries located in the downstream part of the Ourthe catchment, where some threshold was reached very early in the catchment's incision history. Removing the knickpoints stopped at such thresholds from the data set, we calculate an improved m=0.68 and derive a scaling exponent of channel width against drainage area of 0.32, consistent with the average value compiled by Lague for steady state incising bedrock rivers.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>At the border between the states of Ceara and Pernambuco (northeast Brazil), the Chapada do Araripe is a high plateau (800-1000 m a.s.I.) formed by a slab of Cenomanian fluvial sandstone. This caprock is underlain by lacustrine or marine Albian layers and older rift deposits. During the Cretaceous, the Araripe basin lay at a palaeoelevation close to sea-level. Through a presentation and discussion of original field and cartographic data we analyse the mechanisms of topographic inversion in this sedimentary basin in relation to local or regional crustal upwarp. The contrast between the plateau a weakly dissected structural surface and the surrounding lowlands is explained through a study of the erosional scarps cuesta-like landforms and their outliers that fringe the Chapada. No evidence of local tectonic inversion is found. River incision, spring sapping, landslides and other forms of mass movement are listed as efficient processes of topographic inversion and scarp retreat, the rates and patterns of which appear to be controlled by lithological contrasts and conditions of exhumation of the basement. Geometric relationships with regional stepped surfaces (e.g., the low-elevation Sertaneja Surface), exhumed palaeosurfaces and regional drainage systems are analysed. Our estimation of the amplitude of denudation and topographic inversion (0.6-0.7 km) differs significantly from apatite fission-track-derived estimates reported in recent literature, which would imply burial by considerable thicknesses of younger sediments followed by 1.5 km or more of post-rift denudation not just in the study area, but also in the Tucano-Jatoba basin to the south. The exhumation and reworking of surrounding basement surfaces probably began during the early Cenozoic, as shown to the northwest of the Chapada by the presence of widespread laterites of probable Palaeogene age. A second stage of topographic inversion occurred during the Oligocene or later. This would correspond to the major stages of river incision, partial planation and basin inversion.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Much previous work on Late Cenozoic glacial erosion patterns in bedrock has focussed on mountain areas. Here we identify varying impacts of ice sheet erosion on the low-relief bedrock surface of the Fennoscandian shield, and examine the geological, topographical and glaciological controls on these patterns.
   <br>We combine GIS-mapping of topographical, hydrological and weathering data with field observations. We identify and investigate areas with similar geology and general low relief that show different degrees of ice sheet erosional impact, despite similar ice cover histories. On two transects with a total area of similar to 84 000 km(2) across the northern Fennoscandian shield, we first establish patterns of glacial erosion and then examine why glacially streamlined areas exist adjacent to areas of negligible glacial erosion. The northern transect includes two areas of exceptional glacial preservation, the Parkajoki area in Sweden and the so-called ice divide zone in Finland, each of which preserve tors and deep saprolite covers. The southern transect, overlapping in the northern part with the first transect, includes areas of well developed glacial streamlining, with bedrock areas stripped of loose material and barely any weathering remnants.
   <br>For both areas, we firstly present contrasting indicators for ice sheet erosional impact: streamlined and non-streamlined inselbergs; parallel and dendritic/rectangular drainage patterns; and the absence and presence of Neogene weathering remnants. This is followed by an investigation of factors that possibly influence ice sheet erosional impact: ice cover history, ice cover duration and thickness, bedrock type and structure, and topography. We find that the erosional impact of the Fennoscandian ice sheet has varied across the study area. Distinct zones of ice sheet erosion are identified in which indicators of either low or high erosion coexist in the same parts of the transects. No direct impact of rock type on glacial erosion patterns was found, but an indirect control appears clear. Bedrock geology and long-term differential weathering and tectonic evolution determined the topography of the pre-glacial landscape, and these topographic differences subsequently influenced ice sheet dynamics and thereby partly controlled patterns of ice sheet erosion. Ice cover duration and former ice thickness were not significant controls on glacial erosion patterns. Extensive preservation of pre-glacial relief through low glacial erosion is attributed to the maintenance throughout the Pleistocene of divergent flow and frozen-bed conditions in the Fennoscandian ice sheet. In contrast, glacial streamlining and strong glacial erosion were caused mainly by acceleration of flow around major obstacles and flow towards major depressions on the ice sheet bed. The relatively strong ice sheet erosion towards the Gulf of Bothnia is the result of a combination of favourable factors: bedrock structure and river valleys aligned sub-parallel to ice sheet flow and convergent ice flow towards the Baltic.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Erosion surfaces at the top of mountain ranges have suggested to geomorphologists that the Earth's crust can undergo rapid pulses of uplift during which rates of denudation fail to balance with rates of crustal uplift thereby preserving much of the initial plateau topography as it rises to greater elevations. Here we analyze a regionally extensive population of mappable planar surfaces, which crown several major, tectonically active sierras of the inner southeastern Betic Cordillera, SE Spain. Based on a synthesis of long-term landscape evolution involving landform reconnaissance, DEM-based morphometric analysis, structural geology, sediment provenance analysis, and field stratigraphy, we conclude that the summit surfaces are a mosaic of discrete, post-orogenic erosion surfaces that each developed in relation to Mediterranean marine base levels at a time when the sierras formed a series of low-elevation islands. They are not, therefore, fragments of a once regionally continuous paleoplain. The summit surfaces were partly the result of shallow-angle detachment faulting during the middle Miocene in response to lithospheric slab detachment. Where evidence exists that the resulting low-relief topography was reworked by marine abrasion during the Tortonian sea-level rise, the terminal age of the surfaces is latest Miocene. Age-bracketing based on strati-graphic correlations among the many depocentres of the region and on published thermochronological data indicates that some erosion surfaces locally formed in less than 3 million years (similar to 8 Ma-5.7 Ma). They were subsequently uplifted to their current elevations (1.7 to &gt; 2 km) by Pliocene to Quaternary neotectonics in at least two major pulses. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The geomorphological evolution of the Himalayan mountain belt both in terms of crustal deformation and concomitant erosion by surface processes has been suggested to have a profound influence on a number of earth system processes and has been extensively researched through a number of different techniques. The huge catchments of the trans-Himalayan rivers are the product of long-term fluvial erosion of the landscape. This work attempts to understand their evolution through a study of drainage network, morphology, and internal organization of the smaller watersheds nested within each catchment.
   <br>Using morphometric techniques applied to an orogen-wide digital elevation data grid, we characterized the drainage network structure and catchment of all the 18 trans-Himalayan rivers situated between the exits of the Indus and Brahmaputra rivers and constructed rectangular approximations of the catchment geometries. With the help of catchment dimensions measured transverse and parallel to the strike of the orogen, and by analyzing the dimension and spatial dispositions of the rectangular approximations, we demonstrate that the trans-Himalayan catchment shapes cannot be explained only as a product of the headward enlargement of drainage networks on a topographic slope, or orogenic taper. Within individual catchments we identified the existence of drainage components (watersheds) that are organized in a systematic manner with respect to the first-order physiographic features of the Himalayas, formed at different periods of geological time. Each of them shows distinct morphometric characteristics that are indicative of differences in processes and / or time scale involved in their formation. The hypsometric properties of the watersheds occupying the upper part of the catchments suggest that they are the remnants of pre-orogenic drainage that became confined to the leeward side of the Himalayas before the advent of monsoon circulation. The shape and organization of the transverse watersheds occurring in the middle of the catchments resemble a series of small drainage basins formed on the precursor topography of the modern Himalayas. The lower parts of the catchments were shaped instead by drainage diversions induced by deformations related to the frontal thrust. We show how the shape of the catchments represents an integration of processes such as headward drainage enlargement, capture of pre-existing drainage, and diversion of drainage in response to crustal deformation at successive stages of Himalayan mountain growth. We further show that there is a systematic change in the morphological characters and organization of the watersheds, nested in the catchments, from the middle towards the flanks of the Himalayas indicating the variations in relative influence of different drainage evolution processes and the orogen-scale heterogeneity in tectonic style.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The composition of the deep crust is a key to understanding the formation of the low-velocity zone in the middle to lower crust of the Tibetan Plateau. The Suyingdi rhyolites exposed in the northern Qiangtang Terrane have high Sr (296-384 ppm) and low Y (5.81-7.93 ppm), with therefore high Sr/Y ratios (42-56), showing geochemical features of adakitic rocks. Zircon U-Pb dating yields an eruption age of 38.2 +/- 0.8 Ma (MSWD = 0.78). These adakitic rhyolites are high-I( calc-alkaline in composition, displaying a weakly peraluminous character. They have low MgO content (0.20-0.70 wt.%) and Mg-# values (24-39), as well as low Sc (2.25-2.76 ppm), Cr (8-14 ppm), Co (1.6-3.5 ppm) and Ni (2-3 ppm) concentrations. The rocks are LREE-enriched ((La/Yb)(N) = 50-62) and display weakly negative Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu* = 0.82-0.95) and pronounced negative Nb and Ta anomalies. They have low initial (Sr-87/Sr-86)(i); ratios (0.707860 to 0.708342) and enriched Nd isotopic compositions with epsilon(Nd)(t) values ranging from -8.4 to -5.0, which are indistinguishable from those of Cenozoic potassic and ultra-potassic lavas exposed in northern Tibet. Their much higher SiO2 and lower Fe2O3 contents, yet similar MgO, Cr, Co, Ni, and Mg-# values to the potassic and ultra-potassic lavas, however, indicate that the rhyolites are unlikely to have formed by fractional crystallization of these lavas. Because of their low Nb/Ta ratios and similar Sr-Nd isotopic compositions to granulite xenoliths within the Cenozoic potassic rocks, we infer that the Suyingdi adakitic rhyolites were most likely produced by partial melting of a thickened lower crust in the garnet stability field. The magma source is most likely dominated by granulite fades metabasalts and clay-poor metamorphosed sedimentary rocks which indicate that the lower crust of northern Tibet is heterogeneous. In combination with data from previously-reported peraluminous and metaluminous adakitic rocks in the same region, the age and petrogenesis of the Suyingdi adakitic rhyolites suggest that the low-velocity zone in the deep crust of central and northern Tibet was most likely the result of partial melting of thickened crust.

At latitude similar to 19 degrees 30 ' S, a threshold between exoreic and endoreic drainage regimes is clearly associated with the latitudinal gradient imposed by the modern monsoon (carrying humidity from the Atlantic) and disposed obliquely over catchments draining the Andes to the Pacific. We summarize the geomorphic, geological and climatic data in the threshold area. We then use these data to constrain numerical experiments of drainage evolution. Data and experimental results are consistent with the development of a flat low-energy morphology, close to sea level, interrupted at &lt;= 10 Ma by tectonic uplift prevailing to the present suggesting trench-ward relief growth by incorporation of the coastal Atacama region to the Andes mountain belt.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The evolution of sediment flow routing during complete evolution of the Kumano forearc basin is determined through integration of stratigraphic and sediment provenance analyses in the upper Nankai forearc. A new approach uses the compositional variability of detrital clinopyroxenes and orthopyroxenes collected at eight major rivers in Japan and three drill sites in the basin and nearby slope environment, including the first drill cuttings retrieved by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP). Joint interpretation of these datasets reveals that the sedimentation history of the basin is characterised by three main phases separated by newly-recognised time-transgressive boundaries. We show that the Kumano Basin initiated as a trench-slope basin in the early Quaternary (similar to 1.93 Ma) and that it progressively evolved towards an upper slope environment with increased turbidite confinement and influence from climatic forcing. Basin initiation was broadly synchronous with development of the Nankai megasplay fault, suggesting a causal relationship with construction of the Nankai accretionary prism. Unlike preceding studies documenting long-distance longitudinal transport of clastic material along the lower Nankai forearc, only limited longitudinal transport is documented by detrital pyroxenes in the upper forearc. These results suggest that transverse canyons are a major control on the sediment flow routing during maturation of forearc basins and that long-distance longitudinal flows along convergent margins are principally restricted to near-trench environments, even in the presence of large forearc basins.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The response of bedrock channels to differential rock uplift in eastern Qilian Mountain significantly dictates the topographic evolution of the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. Our ability to extract tectonic information directly from channel profiles mainly depends on the calibration of incision processes laws. Here we assess the degree and nature of channels response to differential rock uplift in eastern Qilian Mountain base on an empirical calibration of the shear-stress incision model utilizing field survey data (lithologic resistance, sediment flux, discharge and channel width). Parameters calibration indicates that channels developed in the high mountain zone (HMZ) show an approximate 1.1-1.3 times increase in erosion coefficient K than in the low mountain zone (LMZ), mainly attributing to the adjustments of channel width and discharge. Moreover, profiles analysis reveals a systematic geographic distribution of steepness indices and concavity in this area. The regions of high and low steepness indices are spatially associated with the higher (high rock uplift rates) and lower (low rock uplift rates) parts of landscape, respectively, suggesting that the spatial distribution pattern of channel steepness mainly reflects the differential rock uplift. Channels with abnormal high concavity values apparently associate with the major thrust faults, suggesting that the differential rock uplift is controlled by the thrusting of major active faults. Combining parameters calibration with profile analysis between the two zones, the possible increase in rock uplift rates is 2-4 times in the HMZ than in the LMZ indeed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The SE coastal area of the South China Block (SCB) is generally interpreted as a Cretaceous active continental margin due to subduction of the Paleo-Pacific plate beneath the Eurasian plate. There, the NE SW striking Changle-Nan'ao belt was previously considered as a major strike-slip fault zone with a large displacement accommodating the northward subduction of the Paleo-Pacific plate. Our new field and laboratory investigations document a NW-directed ductile thrust zone that placed gneiss upon Early Cretaceous foliated volcanic rocks. Structural analyses and Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility results indicate that the ductile fabrics in both units are represented by a NE SW striking foliation and a NW SE stretching lineation with top-to-the-NW shear sense. This deformation occurred at ca. 130-105 Ma, before the deposition of undeformed (ca. 104 Ma) volcanic rocks, and the intrusion of ca. 90 Ma isotropic plutons. This continent-ward structure is tentatively interpreted as a back-thrust resulting of the collision of the West Philippines microcontinent with the SCB rather than an effect of a simple oceanic subduction.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The North China Craton (NCC) and Central Asian Orogen Belt (CAOB) in Northeastern China experienced a range of tectonic events during the Phanerozoic, dominated by lithospheric thinning of the eastern NCC in the late Mesozoic and Cenozoic.
   <br>In order to better understand the tectonic evolution of the NCC and the CAOB, new broadband and long period magnetotelluric data were collected along a north-west to southeast trending profile that extended from the CAOB across the Yanshan Belt, the Tanlu Fault Zone to the Liaodong Peninsula. A two-dimensional (2-D) resistivity model was derived from inversion of the transverse electric mode, transverse magnetic mode and vertical magnetic field data. In the crust of the CAOB, the resistivity model shows a northwest dipping low resistivity zone beneath the Solonker suture that is identified as the suture zone formed by the collision between the Siberian and North China cratons.
   <br>The upper mantle of the CAOB is characterized by moderate resistivity values (300-1000 Omega m) that are best explained by the presence of hydrogen dissolved in olivine. The water concentration of the CAOB mantle is comparable to values reported for the asthenosphere and cratons that have been significantly hydrated. The NCC upper mantle is generally lower in resistivity than the CAOB upper mantle, and a zone of lower resistivity is observed in the upper mantle at the southeast end of the profile beneath the NCC (&lt;100 Omega m) which requires around 1% partial melt to account for the observed resistivity.
   <br>Superimposed on this southeast decrease in upper mantle resistivity, three low resistivity zones were imaged: (I) below the Xilamulun fault, (2) close to the North-South Gravity Lineament, and (3) between the northern Yanshan Belt and Tanlu Fault Zone. The low resistivities can be explained as regions of partial melts or fluids, perhaps caused by asthenospheric upwelling.
   <br>Together with seismic imaging results and geochemical data, the resistivity model shows that the modification of the lithosphere associated with craton destruction has occurred in a spatially non-uniform manner in the region of the NCC investigated in this study.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Integrated in the pen-Adriatic domain, the Ionian Basin extended along a NW-SE direction during the Late Cretaceous, limited on its sides by the Apulian and the Kruja platforms. The basinal/slope succession was studied in seven outcrops exposed in the Albanian fold-and-thrust belt. Sedimentological investigations, supported by bio- and chronostratigraphy were performed on calcareous Upper Cretaceous hemipelagites, gravity-flow deposits and slumps. The western part of the basin was studied, revealing a strong influence of the Apulian margin, alternatively shedding sediment basinward, by means of a tectonically controlled edge. The Late Albian to Cenomanian period is characterized by the settling of muddy debrites along the margin. A deep basinal environment characterizes this period which prolongs until the Santonian, with no significant influx of the platform basinward. This sedimentary setting abruptly changed at the end of the Santonian, with an important influx derived from both platforms. Coarsening and thickening upward sequences show a progressive increase in sediment shedding during the Campanian. The Late Campanian-Early Maastrichtian period points out a major change on the resedimentation processes with the settling of several slumped units reworking thick sediment packages. The latter can be traced along the Apulian margin, testifying of instabilities along the edge of Apulia. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Detailed geological mapping in 3-D supported by a LIDAR-derived DOM, sedimentologic and biostratigraphic analyses and 3-D numerical modelling are used to characterise the stratigraphic architecture of deep-water resedimented carbonate systems in the Gargano Peninsula (SE Italy). The base-of-slope succession spanning the upper Aptian to Danian p.p. was subdivided in five lithostratigraphic units that record the complex evolution, and sedimentary dynamic along a segment of the Apulian Platform margin that was strongly influenced by synsedimentary tectonic activity. The characteristic location in a relay zone between the NW-SE trending platform margin and the E-W oriented Mattinata Fault System favoured the existence of a transtentional zone from the upper Aptian up to the end of the Cretaceous. The spatial distribution of the gravity flow deposits, the stratal geometries, the lateral fades changes, and the biostratigraphic data demonstrate that the base-of-slope systems were sourced by distinct platform blocks characterised by different slope profiles (abrupt to west and distally steepened to the north). In this context, the nature and origin of the resedimented carbonate material were controlled by the fracturation of the margin, the response of the carbonate factory to relative sea level changes but were also strongly influenced by the slope profile. This study demonstrates the relevance of combining traditional field work with numerical tools to improve the understanding of ancient sedimentary systems, notably by mapping the stratal architecture and lithologies in continuity and at various scales (on DOMs), and by reconstructing the paleo-topographies in 3-D.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Triassic (Indosinian) granites in the South China Block (SCB) have important tectonic significance for understanding the evolution of Eastern Asia. The Dengfuxian biotite granite in eastern Hunan Province, China, reported in this article, was recognized as Late Triassic (late Indosinian) weakly peraluminous A-type granite with a zircon laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry U-Pb age of 225.7 +/- 1.6Ma. It is enriched in F, Cs, Rb, Th, high field strength elements, and rare earth elements (REEs) and depleted in Ba, Sr, P, Ti, Nb, and Ta, with high Ga/Al ratios and zircon saturation temperatures. The Dengfuxian biotite granite shows high initial Sr isotope values (0.715932 to 0.716499) and negative e(Nd)(t) (-10.46 to -9.67) and e(Hf)(t) (-9.92to-6.29) values, corresponding to the Nd model ages of 1.79 to 1.85Ga and the Hf model ages of 1.65 to 1.88Ga. It is proposed that the Dengfuxian biotite granite was derived from high-temperature partial melting of the Palaeoproterozoic lower crust undergoing granulitization. Some Late Triassic A-type granites were recently identified in the SCB with the ages between 202 and 232Ma. These A-type granites have the same geochemical characteristics and petrogenesis as Dengfuxian A-type granite, and show A(2)-subtype granite affinity. The Late Triassic A-type granite formed a NE-trending granite belt, which is consistent with the main NE-trending faults in the SCB. The formation of these A-type granites was in response to the subduction of the palaeo-Pacific plate underneath the SCB, and indicates an extensional tectonic environment in the SCB. Combined with previous studies on tectonic evolution, we suggest that there may be a tectonic transition inside the SCB from compression to extension at least from 225 to 230Ma.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Several Pb-Zn deposits and occurrences within Iran are hosted by Mesozoic-Tertiary-aged sedimentary and igneous rocks. This study reports new Pb isotope analyses for galena from 14 Pb-Zn deposits in the Alborz and Central Iran structural zones. In general, Pb isotope ratios are extremely variable with data plotting between the upper crustal and orogenic curves in a plumbotectonic diagram. The latter may be attributed to Pb inputs from crustal and mantle end-members. Most of the galena samples are characterized by high Pb-207/Pb-204 ratios, suggesting significant input of Pb from old continental crust or pelagic sediment. Pb isotope data also indicate that some of the deposits, which are hosted by sedimentary rocks in Central Iran and Alborz, have similar Pb isotopic compositions and hence suggest similar source regions. Most of the galenas yield Pb model 'ages' that vary between ~140 and ~250Ma, indicating that mineralization resulted from the extraction of ore-bearing fluids from Upper Triassic-Lower Jurassic sequences. The similarity in Pb isotope ratios for the Pb-Zn deposits located within these zones suggests analogous crustal evolution histories. Our preferred interpretation is that Pb-Zn mineralization within the sedimentary and igneous rocks of the Central Iran and Alborz tectonic regions occurred following a Late Cretaceous-Tertiary accretionary stage of crustal thickening in Iran.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Southeast China, an important part of the circum-Pacific magmatic-metallogenetic belt, was characterized by late Mesozoic extensive magmatism and related metallogenesis. It is now generally accepted that this magmatism was related to subduction of the Palaeo-Pacific plate, and a series of tectonic models such as normal subduction, shallow subduction, and flat-slab subduction have been suggested. Here we propose a new tectonic model involving repeated slab advance-retreat of the Palaeo-Pacific plate on the basis of new geochronological and geochemical data of Late Triassic to Early Jurassic mafic rocks and Early Jurassic A-type granites in southern Jiangxi and western Fujian provinces. The results indicate that Late Triassic (ca. 228Ma) mafic rocks are shoshonitic, formed in a post-collisional regime of the Tethyan tectonic domain. Early Jurassic (ca. 197-191Ma) mafic rocks are sodic, emplaced in a continental arc setting coupled with the subduction of the Palaeo-Pacific plate. Early Jurassic (ca. 189Ma) granites, occurring as a NNE-trending belt, belong to the A(2) group and formed in an extension setting caused by slab break-off. There are an other four A-type granite belts in southeast China, i.e. the Late Triassic, Late Jurassic, Early Cretaceous, and Late Cretaceous A-type granite belts, respectively. Late Triassic (229-221Ma) A-type granites occur as an ENE-trending belt and were coincident with the Late Triassic mafic magmatism. Late Jurassic (163-153Ma), Early Cretaceous (136-124Ma), and Late Cretaceous (101-91Ma) A-type granite belts, together with the Early Jurassic (189Ma) A-type granite belt, are all NNE-trending, parallel to the present coastline. The Late Jurassic belt is located further inland, on the west side of the Early Jurassic belt. The Early Cretaceous belt almost overlaps the Early Jurassic belt and the Late Cretaceous belt is located at the coastal area of southeast China. Integrating these observations, we propose a repeated slab-advance-retreat model for the late Mesozoic magmatic evolution of southeast China. Palaeo-Pacific plate subduction underneath southeast China initiated in the Late Triassic Rhaetian and reached southern Jiangxi by ca. 197Ma, followed by slab rollback during 197-191Ma and by slab break-off at ca. 189Ma. Then slab advance was reestablished with the northwestward subduction approaching southern Hunan at ca. 178Ma. From ca. 174Ma, slab rollback reinitiated and gradually migrated from inland to the coastal area. This repeated slab-advance-retreat model is helpful to further understand the geodynamic mechanism of the late Mesozoic tectono-magmatism and related metallogenesis of southeast China.</td>

Basal shear surfaces and lateral margins of seven recurrent MTDs are mapped to reveal a general NE-SW transport direction throughout the Late Miocene-Quaternary. A key result of our analysis is the perceived relationship between the recurrence of slope instability in the study area and the Dongsha Tectonic Event. Using borehole data to constrain the ages of interpreted MTDs, we show that tectonic uplift in the northern South China Sea led to slope oversteepening in the Late Miocene (between 10.5 Ma and 5.5 Ma), preconditioning it to fail recurrently for more than 10 Ma. Interpreted MTDs are shown to enhance burial depths of source and reservoir units, and improve seal competence in lower-slope areas. Conversely, upper slope regions record important erosion and reduced sealing capacity in Late Cenozoic strata. As a result, we postulate that the thickness variations imposed by MTDs on Late Miocene-Quaternary strata have important implications to petroleum plays in the South China Sea. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>We calculate Plio-Pleistocene slip rates on the blind thrusts of the outer Northern Apennines fronts, that are the potential sources of highly damaging earthquakes, as shown by the M-W 6.1-6.0, 2012 Emilia-Romagna seismic sequence. Slip rates are a key parameter for understanding the seismogenic potential of active fault systems and assessing the seismic hazard they pose, however, they are difficult to calculate in slow deforming areas like the Po Plain where faulting and folding is mostly blind. To overcome this, we developed a workflow which included the preparation of a homogeneous regional dataset of geological and geophysical subsurface information, rich in Plio-Pleistocene data. We then constructed 3D geological models around selected individual structures to decompact the clastic units and restore the slip on the fault planes. The back-stripping of the differential compaction eliminates unwanted overestimation of the slip rates due to compaction-induced differential subsidence. Finally, to restore the displacement we used different methods according to the deformation style, i.e. fault parallel flow for faulted horizons, trishear and elastic dislocation modeling for fault-propagation folds. The result of our study is the compilation of a slip rate database integrating former published values with 28 new values covering a time interval from the Pliocene to the present. It contains data on 14 individual blind thrusts including the Mirandola thrust, seismogenic source of the 29 May 2012, M-W 6.0 earthquake. Our study highlights that the investigated thrusts were active with rates ranging between 0.1 and 1.0 mm/yr during the last 1.81 Myr. The Mirandola thrust slipped at 0.86 +/- 038 mm/yr during the last 0.4 Myr. These rates calculated with a homogeneous methodology through the entire Po Plain can be charged entirely to the thrust activity and not to secondary effects like the differential compaction of sediments across the structures.

In this work, we report a low-temperature thermochronology data set from the northern Tethyan Himalaya and Indus-Yarlung suture zone in the Zedang area, where structures are defined by two parallel thrusts (the Zhongba-Gyantse Thrust to the south and Great Counter Thrust to the north). Eighteen samples from the region constrain their low temperature cooling and exhumation histories and further elucidate the evolution of the southern Tibetan Plateau. Thermal history modelling reveals Eocene and Miocene cooling episodes. Based on the temporal and spatial patterns, Eocene cooling is probably linked to crustal thickening resulting in the Eocene anatexis in the northern Tethyan Himalaya; the rapid pronounced cooling episode between ca. 20 Ma and 15 Ma in the Luobusha area reflects the activity of the Great Counter Thrust (GCT); the ca. 14-10 Ma cooling event of the Yardoi dome can probably be linked to rapid erosional denudation during that period; and pronounced cooling commencing in the middle Miocene was probably caused by incision of branches of the Yarlung-Zangbo River. A further cooling episode commencing in late Miocene time (ca. 5 Ma) in Luobusha area and Yardoi dome, may reflect initial activity of the Cona Graben cutting through the region.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This study emphasizes the advantage of tectonic phase separation in determination of a tectonic evolution of complicated fault zones. The research focused on the Sudetic Marginal Fault Zone (SMFZ) -a 250 km long active fault zone with documented intraplate seismicity situated on the NE margin of the Bohemian Massif (the Czech Republic). The tectonic history of the SMFZ as well as its kinematic development has been rather complicated and not quite understood. A field structural investigation was carried out in extensive surroundings of the fault zone. The fault-slip data were collected in a number of natural outcrops and quarries with the aim at establishing a robust and field-constrained model for local brittle structural evolution of the studied area. A paleostress analysis was calculated using the collected fault-slip data inversion. The T-Tecto software was utilized for semiautomatic separation of the paleostress phases. Simultaneously three methods of data separation were employed: (1) the Gauss inverse method, (2) the Visualization of Gauss object Function, and (3) the frequency analysis. Within the fault zone multiphase movements were observed on various types of faults as well as wide range of the kinematic indicators orientations. The frequency analysis confirmed the multiphase history of the SMFZ. The calculated tectonic phases were divided according to their relative age as constrained by cross cutting relationships and, where observed, multiple striations on a single fault plane and classified from the oldest to the younger. Data separation and inversion using T-Tecto software with the Gauss inverse method revealed four different stress phases which are 3 strike-slip stress regimes and one compressional regime. The strike-slip regimes are characterized by sigma(1) trending NW-SE (43), NNE-SSW (18), ENE-WSW (76) and the compressional one by sigma(1) trending W-E (26). First, compression occurred parallel to the SMFZ supposedly during the Variscan period. Second, compression at an angle of 60A degrees to general direction of the SMFZ yielded right-lateral movement along the fault zone. This is considered to have occurred during the late-Variscan and post-Variscan period. Third, compression in the W-E direction with almost vertical extension led to reverse movement along the fault zone. This is considered to have occurred during Cenozoic. Fourth, compression almost perpendicular to the SMFZ led to left-lateral transpression along the SMFZ. This is considered to have occurred during Quaternary.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Intra-platform shoals are widely developed in the Cambrian-Ordovician of the Tarim Basin, western China, and are prospective for hydrocarbon exploration. Early Paleozoic tectonic evolution of the Tarim Basin was one of the extensions and was followed by compression. The dynamic transformation of the regional plate margins caused differentiation of the intra-platform paleogeomorphology, which imposed changes in the development of sedimentary facies contemporaneous with the development of intra-platform shoals. An integrated model for the recognition of intra-platform shoals was established through outcrop investigation, core observation, logging analysis and seismic data interpretation. Ordovician intra-platform shoals in the Tarim Basin occur as 'shoal containing reefs', 'shoal covering reefs' as well as 'shoal wrapping reefs' and show different characteristics at different periods. Few but large intra-platform shoals are developed in the Penglaiba Formation. Large numbers of small-scale intra-platform shoals are widely developed in the lower member of the Yingshan Formation, whereas larger and thicker intra-platform shoals are widely developed in the upper member of the Yingshan Formation. Intra-platform shoals show successive development characteristics from Penglaiba to Yingshan Formations. This study indicates that the development of intra-platform shoals is controlled by many factors such as platform structure, sea-level change, paleodepth, hydrodynamic condition, and paleogeomorphology, among which sea-level changes and micro-paleogeomorphology play the most significant role. The shoals are found mainly in highstand system tracts of high-frequency depositional cycles. The ideal locations for the development of intra-platform shoals are over micro-uplifts and facing windward paleoslopes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Valley downcutting and tectonically-related landslides have driven the evolution of the landscape in the transitional zone between the Central and Patagonian Andes. Since the onset of the basin's development, around 300 km(3) of rock have been eroded from the plateau. Three-quarters of the erosion occurred in the area undergoing tectonic uplift. Bedrock landslides estimated between similar to 31 to 5 ka caused significant hillslope erosion, at a rate of 0.318 km(3)/ka, and created seven dams. Despite their capacity to remove large amounts of rock from hillslopes, by creating dams, landslides have graded fluvial courses to local base levels and sediments have been trapped at timescales lasting tens of thousands of years. Around 95 percent of the total rock volume involved in large rockslides still remains in the depositional area. Only post-glacial retreat landslides are observed in the mountain area (which was glaciated during the Last Glacial Maximum, LGM), and the only landslide event contemporary to the LGM is located in the piedmont area. These facts indicate that in arid regions such as the study area, landslides do not constitute an important source of sediments to the foreland if there is a lack of coupling between them and an effective massive erosion agent, such as a glacier. Although the removal of large amounts of rock from valley slopes contributes to the degradation of the relief generated by uplift, the results presented here suggest that they might also have counteracted the effects of tectonic uplift by interrupting the sediment flux cycle, trapping sediments and creating positive sediment balances.</td>

The oldest rocks that crop out are the Infra-Cambrian Salt Range Formation. The Salt Range Thrust separates the Infra-Cambrian from Proterozoic rocks, and deposits ranging in age from Infra-Cambrian to Recent are present in the Salt Range. A particular feature of the Salt Range is the presence of a thick salt sequence, and its distribution has affected thrust, normal, and reverse faults. The structural changes across the Salt Range area reflect a systematic variation in the stage of their tectonic development. These structural features are related to the presence of incompetent formations in the successions. The sedimentary record of the Salt Range is filled with thick Infra-Cambrian calcareous to siliciclastic sediments of the Indian Plate and relatively very thick Miocene-Pliocene mollassic deposits of the Indus foredeep. To better understand the relationship of the main tectonic features, these features of the Salt Range are marked on Landsat satellite imagery. Overall, structural interpretation associated with sedimentation styles permits the differentiation between the eastern, central, and western Salt Range.</td>

Phosphate, ironstone, manganese, coal and china clay deposits reported from the area indicate different sedimentary environments including deep marine to carbonate and clastic shallow marine, glaciogenic and fluvial systems. These variable environments were mainly a result of different tectonic events, which were caused by formation and rifting of Rodina, Gondwana, Pangaea, India, Madagascar and collision of India with Eurasia. Phosphate was formed in anoxic shallow marine environments during Cambrian in Sirban Member and Hazira Formation, whereas, ironstone deposits were formed in oxygenated shelf and/or residual mechanisms during nondepositional periods, e. g., at the base of Jurassic and Tertiary successions. China clay was also formed at unconformable surface at the base of Shinwari Formation of Jurassic age. Coal within Chichali Formation was formed in anoxic, organic-rich deltaic shelf conditions. Basin evolution combined with stratigraphic set up of the region has played very important role in formation and exploration of these economic mineral deposits.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Cape Kiber on the Arctic coast of Chukotka, northeast Russia, consists of a granite intruding Devonian (and older?) strata in the core of a large southeast trending anticline. These strata are structurally overlain by Carboniferous and younger strata. A U-Pb age of 351.4 +/- 5.6 (2 sigma) Ma shows that the granite is Early Carboniferous in age. A large granite cobble extracted from a Carboniferous conglomerate produced a Late Devonian or Early Carboniferous U-Pb age of similar to 355-361 Ma. Also, a deformed and altered granitic dyke yielded an age of 363.7 +/- 5.7 (2 sigma) Ma. Major and trace elements suggest a syn-collisional (orogenic) setting. The granite's (biotite) Ar release spectrum is reset. The granitic dyke also shows a disturbed Ar-Ar whole-rock spectrum implying an Early Cretaceous age (similar to 122-130 Ma) for closure of the Ar system. We interpret this as due to widespread greenschist metamorphism accompanying regional deformation of the Anyuy-Chukotka Fold Belt that accompanied closure of the South Anyuy Ocean. Regionally, this event predates deposition of Aptian and Albian strata and the eruption of Okhotsk-Chukotsk magmatic rocks. An Ar-Ar (biotite) plateau age of 96.4 +/- 1.0 (2 sigma) Ma from a mildly deformed, lamprophyre dyke reflects intrusion in a setting of regional extension. Its deformation reflects a younger tectonic event. The record of Devonian-Carboniferous magmatism and early Carboniferous unroofing is younger and less complex than that of Arctic Alaska. However, evidence for Early Devonian (Caledonian) or Late Devonian (Ellesmerian) deformation could have been masked by intense Mesozoic deformation. Outcrop data and geochronology support and refine regional interpretations of Early Cretaceous deformation and mineral growth accompanying accretion of Chukotka to north Asia, followed by regional extension and subsequent convergent deformation.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Three regional unconformity surfaces typify the Plio-Pleistocene fill of the onshore to offshore basins of the Calabrian Arc, an arcuate terrane migrating to the SE above the NW subducting Ionian lithosphere, between the southern Apennines and Sicily. These unconformity surfaces formed in the mid-Pliocene (late Zanclean to early Piacenzian), the early Pleistocene (intra-Gelasian) and the mid-Pleistocene (late Calabrian). Their expression varies significantly across the area, so that from one to three unconformities may be recognized within any given basin. Several lines of evidence suggest that the spatially variable development of the unconformities across the Arc records interruptions of subsidence by phases of uplift and deformation, related to the extent and nature of successive tectonic events linked to episodic subduction zone retreat and slab fragmentation during the Plio-Pleistocene interval. In particular, the mid-Pliocene unconformity is associated with uplift and deformation on the Ionian flank of the Calabrian Arc that interrupted a phase of basin subsidence coeval with opening of the Vavilov back-arc basin, and may record either interference of the Arc with the Apulian microplate, or an episode of out-of-sequence tectonic thickening within the advancing accretionary wedge. The two Pleistocene unconformities bracket a phase of basin collapse in northern Calabria that coincides with the ultra-fast opening of the Marsili backarc basin, and are associated with uplift and contractional-transpressional deformation that record interference of the subducting slab with adjacent microplates. The recognition of a synchronous development of unconformities in the Calabrian basins provides key references for further studies of the geodynamic evolution of the central Mediterranean.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Salento peninsula is a well-known Apulian tourist area. Its peculiar geological and geomorphological features also have attracted numerous researchers during the last 150 years. The importance of the Salento geological heritage and identification of key sites was determined by literature review, assessment of the records of field trips in and around the Salento area during scientific geological meetings, and conferences over the last 30 years, using a geographical information system. Furthermore, these sites identified are the Otranto-Castro and Gallipoli-Porto Selvaggio coastal areas, the area of Leuca as well as the area between Cursi and Melpignano. The Otranto-Castro area contains Late Cretaceous Rudist reefs and Ammonites, an Upper Oligocene reef complex, as well as Lower Pleistocene calcarenites containing slumps and erosional features. The coastal landscape is marked by boulder accumulations produced by a historical tsunami. The Gallipoli-Porto Selvaggio area is noted for its abundant remains of Strombus bubonius Lamarck. In Porto Selvaggio, there is a rich fossiliferous association with abundant taxa of fish found in Cretaceous dolomitic and calcareous layers, with the rocks showing thin chert layers and spectacular slump features that had been triggered by tectonic activity. The Leuca area is the location for the stratotype of the Leuca Formation and by the occurrence of Grotta del Diavolo, a coastal cave that exhibits polycyclic evolution in the Middle Pleistocene. Finally, the Cursi-Melpignano area is important for its numerous quarries of Pietra Leccese Formation that have yielded numerous fossils of Miocene marine vertebrates. The results from the analysis point to the valuable geological heritage of the Salento area which is still completely unexploited by the local tourist industry. Data reported in this paper could be usefully integrated in plans aiming to build a cultural tourist attraction in Salento area.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Passo Feio complex (PFC) is a sequence of metapelite, amphibolite, metavolcanic/metavolcanoclastic rocks, marble, calc-silicate rocks, quartzite and magnesium schist. It is part of the Sao Gabriel Terrane, a Neoproterozoic juvenile arc formed during the early stages of evolution of the Neoproterozoic Dom Feliciano Belt (DFB), in southern Brazil. This belt corresponds to the southernmost portion of the Mantiqueira Province, an important Neoproterozoic orogenic system exposed in the NNE direction along the southeastern coast of Brazil. The geotectonic significance of the original Passo Feio basin in the tectonic evolution of Sao Gabriel Terrene is not well understood. It has been considered as part of a passive margin sequence or as a back-arc sequence. Geochronological and isotopic data are very scarse for the Passo Feio rocks and this has hampered the better understanding of its significance in the Neoproterozoic tectonic evolution of southern Brazil. In the present study the age and significance of metasedimentary rocks of the PFC were investigated. The provenance study was carried out in four metapelite samples from the southern and northern Passo Feio complex, using U-Pb dating of detrital zircon. The results showed varied provenance patterns and zircon ages range from 3637 to 803 Ma. Paleo- and Mesoproterozoic detrital zircon grains are present in all samples, but an important Neoproterozoic population has been identified in one of them. 3.5 Ga old zircon grains form the oldest population of detrital zircon ever reported in southern Brazil. Paleoproterozoic/Archean terranes within the Rio de la Plata Craton may represent the main source of detrital sediments and this suggests that part of the Passo Feio complex might have been a passive margin sequence, developed along the northeastern margin of that paleocontinent However, the presence of a Neoproterozoic zircon population is not consistent with derivation solely from the craton and indicates contribution from younger sources, such as the Neoproterozoic Sao Gabriel Arc itself. This Neoproterozoic zircon population with ages ranging from 948 to 803 Ma, suggests that the onset of the magmatic/tectonic evolution of the Sao Gabriel Arc might have started as early ca. 0.95 Ma.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In the Forquilha area (NE Brazil), in NW Borborema Province, high to ultra-high pressure rocks are an important geological key to understanding West Gondwana amalgamation. U-Pb geochronological data for a retrograded eclogite sample yielded an upper intercept age of ca. 1520 Ma and a lower intercept age of ca. 620 Ma. These ages most likely represent the crystallization age of the basaltic protolith and the regional metamorphism, respectively. The retrograded eclogites are enclosed in migmatized quartz-feldspathic gneiss and sillimanite (after Icyanite)-garnet-biotite gneiss. Detrital U-Pb zircon data for these paragneisses show only Paleoproterozoic zircon grains with ages clustering from ca. 1800 Ma (the maximum depositional age) to ca. 2480 Ma, and frequency peaks at 2.2-2.0 Ga. Combined with Nd isotopic data from the Forquilha paragneisses, one can assume a single Paleoproterozoic source. Basement rocks of the Ceara Central and the Rio Grande do Norte domains are the most likely candidates. The absence of Meso- and Neoproterozoic zircon grains suggest that the retrograded eclogite bodies possibly do not represent slivers of oceanic rocks captured in active margin sequences during subduction. It was identified that the high-pressure rocks of the Forquilha area are in tectonic contact with high-pressure granulite fades rocks of the Ceara Complex (Independencia unit) that present detrital zircon records of an active margin setting, with ages ranging from ca. 660 Ma to 2200 Ma. Metamorphism of this sequence occurred at ca. 650 Ma. Considering previous studies, field relationships, and metamorphic paragenesis, a tectonic scenario is inferred, in which the Forquilha retrograded eclogites represent Mesoproterozoic basaltic rocks of an extensional event that were metamorphosed under eclogite facies conditions during Late Neoproterozoic continental subduction/collision, and juxtaposed to an active margin sequence during the exhumation process.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Carbonate fault breccia dykes in the Cerro La Chilca area, Eastern Precordillera, west-central Argentina, provide clues on the probable mechanism of both fault movement and dyke injection.
   <br>Breccia dykes intrude Upper Carboniferous sedimentary rocks and Triassic La Flecha Trachyte Formation. The timing of breccia dyke emplacement is constrained by cross cutting relationships with the uppermost Triassic unit and conformable contacts with the Early Miocene sedimentary rocks. This study supports a tectonic-hydrothermal origin for these breccia dykes; fragmentation and subsequent hydraulic injection of fluidized breccia are the more important processes in the breccia dyke development.
   <br>Brecciation can be triggered by seismic activity which acts as a catalyst. The escape of fluidized material can be attributed to hydrostatic pressure and the direction of movement of the material establishes the direction of least pressure.
   <br>Previous studies have shown that cross-strike structures have had an important role in the evolution of this Andean segment since at least Triassic times. These structures represent pre-existing crustal fabrics that could have controlled the emplacement of the dykes. The dykes, which are composed mostly of carbonate fault breccia, were injected upward along WNW fractures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>U-Pb zircon ages of igneous and metaigneous rocks in orogenic belts provide important information concerning the occurrence and duration of magmatic and metamorphic events whereas detrital zircon ages of metasedimentary sequences place constrains on the sources and deposition ages of supracrustal rocks. With these data, it is possible to compare and establish correlations between different provinces or between domains of the same province. A sufficiently large dataset of U-Pb ages is now available from the Borborema Province, northeastern Brazil, allowing the use of statistical methods to identify age peaks. 210 U-Pb crystallization ages from magmatic rocks and ca. 2300 U-Pb zircon ages of detrital grains from metasedimentary rocks were compiled. The igneous age spectrum shows two large age clusters. The first spans about 300 Ma, from 2.25 Ga to 1.97 Ga. Orthogneissic complexes in the Rio Grande do Norte Domain have ages mainly between 2.22 and 2.15 Ga whereas in the remainder of the province they more commonly range from 2.18 to 2.0 Ga. The long duration of this magmatism is comparable to that of Neoproterozoic and Phanerozoic accretionary/collisional orogens and is inferred to have resulted from amalgamation of preexisting crustal blocks and juvenile material to the active margin of the Rio Grande do Norte Domain. The other large cluster of ages is much narrower, from 650 Ma to 550 Ma, which is more consistent with the duration of orogenesis in collisional belts. Orogenic granitoids older than 600 Ma were not yet identified in the Rio Grande do Norte Domain, perhaps reflecting a thicker lithosphere that delayed initiation of the Brasiliano Orogeny.
   <br>In contrast with the igneous rock-zircon record, the detrital zircon record requires sources with ages that span almost the whole Proterozoic eon. The presence of zircons ages in the 1.5-1.0 Ga and 0.85 0.65 Ga intervals, which contrasts with their absence, in the first case, or rarity, in the second case, amongst the igneous rocks, may be explained by derivation from igneous sources as yet undiscovered or removed by erosion, and/or by provenance from distal sources. The occurrence of 2.15-2.05 Ga-old detrital zircons in the Rio Grande do Norte Domain and of Tonian zircons in this domain and in the Ceara Central and Medio Coread domains imply the inexistence of physical barriers separating the northern and southern domains of the Borborema Province during the Neoproterozoic. The results are consistent with deposition in an intracratonic setting that became the site of lithospheric extension in response to far-field stresses. The ages of the youngest detrital zircons (650-630 Ma) indicate that deposition ended just before or at the beginning of the Brasiliano Orogeny. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Alto Moxoto Terrane is a Paleoproterozoic inlier within the Transversal Domain of the Neoproterozoic Borborema Province (NE Brazil). An isotopic and whole-rock geochemistry study has been performed in the Sucuru region (Paraiba State, NE Brazil) which revealed a long-lived evolution for this terrane. The first event is Siderian-aged, dated on 2.44 Ga, being represented by granitic to granodioritic banded orthogneisses and migmatites of the basement. They correspond to meta to peraluminous high-K calc-alkaline series, where geochemical patterns besides zircon features and Nd isotopic data indicate that they were formed in a convergent tectonic environment with reworking of an older Archean continental crust. This basement was intruded by different magmatic suites through two distinct tectonomagmatic events. The older one is Rhyacian-aged recorded by emplacement of the Carmo maficultramafic suite and Pedra d'Agua granitic suite, with ages varying from 2.15 to 2.0 Ga. The Carmo Suite shows compositions similar to tholeiitic and minor calc-alkaline series and geochemical patterns of a depleted source. These general chemical characteristics are compatible with an arc-related magmatism in early stages of subduction. The Pedra d'Agua suite corresponds to middle to peraluminous high-K calcalkaline magmatism which presents a typical magmatic arc geochemical signature. The negative eNd (t) values suggest a strong continental component for genesis of these magmas. The last tectonomagmatic episode occurred in the Statherian-Calymmian boundary and is represented by bimodal magmatic association of the Serra da Barra Suite, dated around 1.6 Ga. The dominant felsic rocks present an evolved composition and correspond to typical metaluminous sub-alkaline suite. The trace-element and REE patterns of both mafic and mainly felsic rocks suggest a within-plate setting. The attributed source is of crustal derivation, which is supported by the negative eNd (t) values. A mantle plume can be invoked for mechanism of generation of the Serra da Barra magmatism. This polycyclic Paleoproterozoic evolution observed at Alto Moxoto terrane is also well documented in orogenic terranes worldwide, mainly those related to Atlantica supercontinent amalgamation. On the other hand, Statherian-Calymmian extensional event is also coherent with worldwide descriptions and are commonly referred to early break-up stage of the large Paleoproterozoic land masses.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>From the Archean to the end of the Neoproterozoic the Borborema Province, northeast Brazil went through a complex polycyclic geologic evolution, ending, between 660 and 570 Ma, with the Brasiliano/Pan-African orogeny that led to West Gondwana amalgamation. Evolution of the metasedimentary covers of the Province, from the beginning of their deposition up to their involvement in the Brasiliano/ Pan-African collision, is a key element in understanding formation of Gondwana and in attempts in predrift correlation between South America and West Africa. One of these covers, the Ceara Group, is exposed in the Ceara Central domain. Aiming to unravel the history of the Ceara Group, we carried out a geochronologic study of representative samples, combining Sm-Nd isotopic data, conventional U-Pb TIMS dating of zircon and U-Pb SHRIMP age determination of detrital zircon grains. Our results show that sedimentation of the Ceara Group started around 750 Ma, following rifting of the Archean/Paleoproterozoic basement, associated with bimodal volcanism. The interlayered basic volcanic rocks, recrystallized into garnet amphibolites, show a concordant age of 749 +/- 5 Ma interpreted as the age of crystallization. About 90% of calculated Sm Nd TDM model ages of metasedimentary rocks are Paleoproterozoic and more than 50% of the analyzed samples have TDM between 1.95 and 2.4 Ma, with strongly negative epsilon Nd, consistent with provenance mainly from the Paleoproterozoic basement. Strong contrast between Paleoproterozoic TDM with negative epsilon Nd and young TDM (Mesoproterozoic) with slightly positive epsilon Nd is interpreted as a consequence of changes in detritus provenance induced by geomorphologic alterations resulting from tectonic activity during rifting. Ages of detrital zircon grains obtained by SHRIMP U-Pb analyses show three main groups: about 1800 Ma, 1000-1100 Ma and ca. 800 Ma which corresponds to the bimodal magmatism associated, respectively to the Oros-Jaguaribe domain, Cariris Velhos event and Independencia Group.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In pre-drift reconstructions, the central and southern parts of the Borborema Province, northeastern Brazil, belong to a large Brasiliano-Pan-African orogenic realm situated to the north of the Sao FranciscoCongo Craton. In order to better understand the timing and geodynamic setting under which this orogenic system developed, a structural, geochemical and geochronological study was conducted across the east Pernambuco shear zone (EPSZ) system, which separates the Pernambuco-Alagoas Domain (PEAL) from the Central Domain. A sample of the Pinhoes orthogneiss (GE-1), in the Central Domain, one sample of a syenitic orthogneiss (CA-34) wrapped by the EPSZ, and one sample of orthogneiss named Altinho (CA-40), in the northern portion of the PEAL, were dated by LA-ICP-MS. The Pinhoes orthogneiss yielded an age of 869 +/- 9 Ma, interpreted as the emplacement age of the protolith during a late Tonian magmatic episode. Samples CA-40 and CA-34 yielded Pb-206/U-238 weighted mean ages of 652 +/- 6 Ma and 636 +/- 3 Ma, respectively, which are interpreted as dating emplacement and crystallization of the magmatic protoliths. However, it is also possible that these rocks were formed during the same magmatic event in view of the identical ages of 646 +/- 13 Ma and 646 +/- 11 Ma, respectively, given by the less precise upper intercept of the discordia lines. The metaluminous and magnesian nature of the Altinho orthogneiss is akin to the calc-alkalic suite. However, some samples plot in the intraplate field in tectonic discrimination diagrams and the Nd T-DM model age of 1.36 Ga is unlike that of juvenile magmas in convergent settings. The Altinho orthogneiss is quite similar in terms of trace elements geochemistry to the syenitic orthogneiss, which has a clearer intraplate affinity, and the dated samples have identical initial Sr isotope ratios (0.7047). Therefore, emplacement in an extensional setting is preferred over a convergent one. Two samples of paragneisses (SB-1 and BB-9) from the PEAL were also dated. The ages of the youngest zircon grains in sample BB-9 (655-642 Ma) overlap the crystallization age of the Altinho orthogneiss, implying that sedimentation is younger than or, at best, synchronous with magmatism. The age of low Th/U grains in samples CA-34 (615 +/- 8 Ma) and SB-1 (587 +/- 12 Ma) are related to a subsequent metamorphic overprint, which is loosely constrained between 580 and 620 Ma. These observations, combined with evidence provided by previous studies, suggest that the change from an extensional to a contracional setting occurred at Ca. 640-630 Ma. In contrast with most collisional orogens, where a long period of oceanic subduction precedes collision, the inferred tectonic evolution suggests that the Brasiliano Orogeny resulted from inversion of continental and/or proto oceanic rifts.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Sergipano belt is the outcome of collision between the Pernambuco-Alagoas Domain (Massif) and the Sao Francisco Craton during Neoproterozoic assembly of West Gondwana. Although the understanding of the Sergipano belt evolution has improved significantly, the timing of emplacement, geochemistry and tectonic setting of granitic bodies in the belt is poorly known. We recognized two granite age groups: 630-618 Ma granites in the Canincle, Pogo Redondo and Macurure domains, and 590-570 Ma granites in the Macurure metasedimentary domain. U Pb SHRIMP zircon ages for granites of first age group indicated ages of 631 +/- 4 Ma for the Sitios Novos granite, 623 +/- 7 Ma for the Pogo Redondo granite, 619 +/- 3.3 Ma for the Lajedinho monzodiorite, and 618 +/- 3 Ma for the Queimada Grande granodiorite. These granitoids are dominantly high-K calc-alkaline, magnesian, metaluminous, mafic enclave-rich (Queimada Grande and Lajedinho), or with abundant inherited zircon grains (Pogo Redondo and Sitios Novos). Geochemical and isotope data allow us to propose that Sitios Novas and Pogo Redondo granites are product of partial melting of Pogo Redondo migmatites. Sr-Nd isotopes of the Queimada Grande granodiorite and Lajedinho monzodiorite suggest that their parental magma may have originated by mixing between a juvenile mafic source and a crustal component that could be the Pogo Redondo migmatites or the Macurure metasediments. Other 630-618 Ma granites in the belt are the mafic enclave-rich Coronel Joao S granodiorite and the Camara tonalite in the Macurure sedimentary domain. These granites have similar geochemical and isotopic characteristics as the Lajedinho and Queimada Grande granitoids. We infer for the Camara tonalite and Coronel Joao S granodiorite that their parental magmas have had contributions from mafic lower crust and felsic upper crust, most probably from underthrust Sao Francisco Craton, or Pernambuco-Alagoas Domain. The younger 590-570 Ma granite group is confined to the Macurure metasedimentary domain. Although these granites do not show typical features of S-type granites, their U Pb age, field relationships, geochemical and Sr-Nd data suggest that their parental magmas have originated from high degree melting of the Macurure micaschists. Field observations support a model in which the Macurure domain, limited by the Belo MonteJeremoabo and Sao Miguel do Aleixo shear zones, behaved as a ductile channel flow for magma migration and emplacement during the Neoproterozoic, very much like the channel flow model proposed for emplacement of leucogranites in the Himalayas.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Borborema Province of northeastern Brazil is a major Proterozoic crustal province that, until now, has never been explored using deep crustal seismic methods. Here are reported the first results obtained from a high-quality seismic refraction/wide-angle reflection profile that has defined the internal seismic velocity structure and thickness of the crust in this region. Almost 400 recording stations were deployed in the Deep Seismic Refraction (DSR) experiment through an NW-SE ca. 900 km linear array and 19 shots were exploded at every 50 km along the line. Data from the 10 southeastern most shots of the seismic profile were processed in this work. The main features and geological structures crossed by the studied portion of the profile belong to the so-called Central Sub-province of the Borborema tectonic province. The crustal model obtained is compatible with a typical structure of extended crust. The model was essentially divided into three layers: upper crust, lower crust, and a half-space represented by the shallower portion of the mantle. The Moho is an irregular interface with depth ranging between 31.7 and 34.5 km, and beneath the Central Sub-province it varies from 31.5 to 33 km depth, where its limits are related to major crustal discontinuities. The distribution of velocities within the crust is heterogeneous, varying vertically from 5.7 to 6.3 km/s in the upper crust and from 6.45 to 6.9 km/s in the lower crust. From the average crustal velocity distribution it is evident that the Central Sub-province has seismic characteristics different from neighboring domains. The crust is relatively thin and crustal thickness variations in the profile are subtle due to stretching that occurred in the Cretaceous, during the fragmentation of Pangaea, opening of the South Atlantic Ocean and separation of South America from Africa.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>We describe a 1 km-thick ultramylonite forming the high strain base of the &gt;3.5 km-thick El Pichao shear zone in the Sierra de Quilmes. This shear zone thrusted granulite facies migmatites onto amphibolite facies rocks during the 470 Ma Famatinian orogeny. Strain grades upwards from ultramylonites to weakly sheared migmatites across the 3.5 km-zone and the mylonitic rocks define a geochemical field narrower than the protolith, suggesting they underwent mixing and homogenization through shearing. Ultramylonites this thick are uncommon. The width of a shear zone, in the absence of significant compositional rheological contrasts controlling strain localization, is controlled by the balance between shear heat generation and diffusion. Under typical crustal conditions a strain rate of 10(-12) s(-1) is required to form a 1 km-thick ultramylonite, and this is achieved when large movement velocities are imposed across the shear zone. We postulate that the El Pichao shear zone and its thick ultramylonite accommodated a significant fraction of convergence velocities driving the orogeny, and that the wide mylonitic shear zones characteristic of the Cambrian-Ordovician deformation of the Sierras Pampeanas result from the convergent movement being taken up by only a few active major shear zones.

In this area the North Anatolian Shear Zone results in a transpressional deformation zone that extends between two master faults striking parallel to the main shear direction. The main systems of structures identified in the deformation zone appear to be oriented parallel to the directions predicted by Riedel theoretical model. Nevertheless, the strain partitioning is more complicated than predicted by theory. The structural analysis suggests a polyphase deformation characterized by a steady component of transcurrence associated with alternance of compression and extension. Along each of theoretical directions the combination of double verging structures can be observed, with folds and thrust surfaces root into high-angle shear zones, according to flower-type geometries. The discrepancies of directions, kinematics and geometries from theoretical models are due to transpressive and/or transtensive nature of the deformation. According to the observed outcropping structures, we propose a conceptual model for the North Anatolian Shear Zone, interpreting it as a crustal-scale positive flower structure.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Uranium and polymetallic U mineralization hosted within brecciated albitites occurs one kilometer south of the magnetite-rich Au-Co-Bi-Cu NICO deposit in the southern Great Bear magmatic zone (GBMZ), Canada. Concentrations up to 1 wt% U are distributed throughout a 3 by 0.5 km albitization corridor defined as the Southern Breccia zone. Two distinct U mineralization events are observed. Primary uraninite precipitated with or without pyrite-chalcopyrite +/- molybdenite within magnetite-ilmenite-biotite-K-feldspar-altered breccias during high-temperature potassic-iron alteration. Subsequently, pitchblende precipitated in earthy hematite-specular hematite-chlorite veins associated with a low-temperature iron-magnesium alteration. The uraninite-bearing mineralization postdates sodic (albite) and more localized high-temperature potassic-iron (biotite-magnetite +/- K-feldspar) alteration yet predates potassic (K-feldspar), boron (tourmaline) and potassic-iron-magnesium (hematite +/- K-feldspar +/- chlorite) alteration. The Southern Breccia zone shares attributes of the Valhalla (Australia) and Lagoa Real (Brazil) albitite-hosted U deposits but contains greater iron oxide contents and lower contents of riebeckite and carbonates. Potassium, Ni, and Th are also enriched whereas Zr and Sr are depleted with respect to the aforementioned albitite-hosted U deposits. Field relationships, geochemical signatures and available U-Pb dates on pre-, syn- and post-mineralization intrusions place the development of the Southern Breccia and the NICO deposit as part of a single iron oxide alkali-altered (IOAA) system. In addition, this case example illustrates that albitite-hosted U deposits can form in albitization zones that predate base and precious metal ore zones in a single IOAA system and become traps for U and multiple metals once the tectonic regime favors fluid mixing and oxidation-reduction reactions.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Originally discovered by Leonard da Vinci in the 15th century, the force of friction is directly proportional to the applied load (known as Amontons first law of friction). Furthermore, kinetic friction is independent of the sliding speed (known as Coulombs law of friction). These empirical laws break down at high normal pressure (due to plastic deformation) and low sliding speed (in the transition regime between static friction and kinetic friction). An important example of this phenomenon is friction between the asperities of tectonic plates on the Earth. Despite its significance, little is known about the detailed mechanism of friction in this regime due to the lack of experimental methods. Here we demonstrate in situ time-lapse nanoscopy of friction between asperities sliding at ultralow speed (similar to 0.01 nm/s) under high normal pressure (similar to GPa). This is made possible by compressing and rubbing a pair of nanometer-scale crystalline silicon anvils with electrostatic microactuators and monitoring its dynamical evolution with a transmission electron microscope. Our analysis of the time-lapse movie indicates that superplastic behavior is induced by decrystallization, plastic deformation, and atomic diffusion at the asperity-asperity interface. The results hold great promise for a better understanding of quasi-static friction under high pressure for geoscience, materials science, and nanotechnology.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The paper addresses the morphology and age relations of plain terrains on Venus. The stratigraphically oldest and strongly tectonized complexes of this planet are remnants of plains made up of tessera-forming tectonic structures. This suggests that tessera terrains were formed mostly by eruptions of low-viscosity (likely basaltic) lavas. The stratigraphically oldest units, in which volcanic activity played a leading role, are shield plains, whose morphology testifies that they were produced by numerous but relatively weak eruptions of basaltic material from likely shallow-sitting chambers. The only Venusian landforms whose shapes suggest eruptions of high-viscosity lavas are festoons and steep-sided domes. The great majority of the domes is spatially and stratigraphically related to the shield plains, and this testifies that the type of volcanism during the origin of the plains was unusual and favorable for the local derivation of highly viscous lavas. The mechanisms that could possibly form the steep-sided domes suggest that the domes were most likely produced by eruptions of silica-enriched (and hence, more viscous) melts that had been generated by crystallization differentiation in chambers. The surface topography of the younger regional plains suggests that these plains were produced by large-volume but brief eruptions of basaltic (or perhaps, also komatiitic) lavas (lava flooding). The surface areas and possible volumes of the regional plains are more consistent with their generation via melting portions of mantle material that had replaced delaminated blocks of lithospheric roots. The morphology, character of spatial distribution, and typical associations of the lobate plains suggest that they were formed during melting of the head portions of mantle diapirs. The morphologic parameters of the dominant volcanic complexes on Venus (shield, regional, and lobate plains) and their unvarying stratigraphic relations highlight a clearly pronounced character of the evolution of volcanic activity in the geological history of Venus.</td>

According to the ages obtained by U-Pb zircon dating (Amanan complex-162.6 +/- 1.4 Ma, granites and monzonite-porphyry of the ore-bearing complex-159.0 +/- 1.6 and 157.5 +/- 2.9 Ma), the Amanan complex formed at the end of collision, and the ore-bearing porphyry complex, during the change of the geodynamic regime by the postcollisional (rift) one. The rocks of two complexes have high contents of LILE and LREE and low contents of HFSE and HREE. The (Sr-87/Sr-86)(0) ratio in the gabbro and granites of the Amanan complex is 0.70501 and 0.70534, respectively, and that in the rocks of the porphyry complex is within 0.70451-0.70633. The Amanan gabbro, gabbro-diorites, and granites are characterized by epsilon(Nd)(T) = -1.4, -1.8, and -10.3, respectively, and the rocks of the ore-bearing complex, by epsilon(Nd)(T) = -3.7 to + 1.0. The model T-Nd(DM) age of the Amanan granites is 1.5 Ga, and that of the granites and porphyry of the ore-bearing complex is 1.0-0.8 Ga. The Pb isotope ratios in the rocks of the Amanan and porphyry complexes are: Pb-206/Pb-204 = 18.086-18.136 and 18.199-18.442, Pb-207/Pb-204 = 15.487-15.499 and 15.506-15.545, and Pb-208/Pb-204 = 38.046-38.256 and 38.230-38.456. The results of geological, geochemical, and isotope studies admit that magmas were generated from juvenile and ancient crusts. Melts probably ascended from a depth of no less than 55 km during the melting of crust thickened as a result of tectonic deformations (in the upper horizons) and during the basic-magma supply (in the lower horizons). Juvenile mafic crust is considered to be the major source of fluid components and metals. Favorable conditions for the ore generation in the magmatic system during the formation of the porphyry complex arose at the previous stage, during the formation of the Amanan complex, which we regard as a preparatory stage in the evolution of the long-living ore-magmatic system.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The discovery of oil and gas in the Barmer Basin in northwest India was one of the more significant global discoveries in the decade 2001-2010. The basin's presence was suspected from gravity and magnetic data in the late 1980s but not confirmed until 1999 from seismic and drilling. The basin is a lacustrine failed rift. Biostratigraphic data, however, indicate it was intermittently connected to marine waters via either the Cambay Basin, the Kutch Basin, or across the Devikot high, temporarily forming a large, shallow estuary. At least six major tectono-stratigraphic events have caused relative lake level falls and translation of elastic reservoirs basinward. Upward of 6 km (similar to 20,000 ft) of Cenozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks have been preserved. Prolific source rocks occur from the Mesozoic through Eocene strata.
   <br>Tectonically, the basin is divided into a northern and a southern province. The north province continues to undergo inversion and erosion, and has not been buried as deeply as the south. Kinetics of the major source facies in the north are substantially different from those in the south, as well as the present-day and paleo-heat flow. These differences have made the northern part of the basin predominantly an oil province and the southern part a mixed oil and gas province.
   <br>The prolific Paleocene Fatehgarh Formation contains the bulk of the 7.3 billion barrels of stock tank oil in place (STOIP) identified to date, but other reservoirs from the Mesozoic to the late Cenozoic are common and may yield significant future resource additions.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Terceira Island, in the Azores Archipelago, lies at the intersection of four submarine volcanic ridges. New high-resolution bathymetric and seismic reflection data have been used to analyze the main volcanic, tectonic and mass-wasting features of the island offshore. Volcanic features such as linear volcanic centers, and pointy and flat-topped cones are mainly concentrated on the narrow western and north-western ridges, characterized by an overall rugged morphology. Fault scarps dominate mainly the broad eastern and south-eastern ridges, which are characterized by an overall smooth and terrace-like morphology. On the eastern ridge, faults form a series of horsts and grabens related to the onshore Lajes Graben. The strikes of the fault scarps, linear volcanic centers and alignment of volcanic cones on the ridges reveal two main structural trends, WNW-ESE and NNW-SSE, consistent with the main tectonic structures observed on the Azores Plateau. In contrast, a large variability of strike was observed in inter-ridge areas, reflecting the relative importance of regional and local stresses in producing these structures. Mass-wasting features are subordinate and mostly represented by hundred meter-wide scars that indent the edge of the insular shelf surrounding the island, apart from two large, deeper scars identified on the southern steep flank of the western ridge. Finally, the remarkable morphostructural differences between the western and eastern ridges are discussed in the framework of the evolution of the Terceira volcanic edifice and hypothesized to reflect successive stages of ridge evolution.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Middle Cambrian Mount Read Volcanics of western Tasmania, Australia, host several world-class volcanic-hosted massive sulfide (VHMS) deposits, representing a wide range of deposit styles. Although the deposits and their host sequences are variably deformed and locally preserve spectacular examples of primary textures and structures, rapid lateral and vertical facies changes, and faults with uncertain sense and magnitude of displacement, have made it impossible to correlate stratigraphy across the belt. Previous dating studies in the area have yielded relatively imprecise crystallization ages. We have employed the chemical abrasion isotope dilution thermal ionization mass spectroscopy (ID-TIMS) U-Pb zircon method to obtain highly precise crystallization ages for a total of 18 samples of volcanic and intrusive rock units from throughout the Mount Read Volcanics and underlying mafic-ultramafic complexes. The new data permit detailed resolution of age relationships Within the belt. The study establishes an age of 516.0 +/- 0.9 Ma for the McIvor Hill gabbro, which is part of a mafic-ultramafic complex interpreted to underlie the Mount Read Volcanics. Magmatism in the central Mount Read Volcanics lasted at least 12.7 m.y., from 506.8 +/- 1.0 Ma for a massive dacite unit in the lower part of the Central Volcanic Complex to 496.0 +/- 0.9 Ma for a welded ignimbrite in the lower Tyndall Group. Together with previous age constraints, results of the study provide a precise chronostratigraphic framework for magmatism and VHMS deposit formation within the Mount Read Volcanics. The precise age data indicate that, north of the Henty fault, magmatism occurred in three discrete pulses, at least two of which were separated by periods of sedimentation. We demonstrate that VHMS deposits in the Mount Lyell, Roseberry-Hercules, and QueHellyer districts, comprising the majority of the known, significant VHMS deposits in the belt, formed within a narrow time interval at similar to 500 +/- 1 Ma, at a relatively late stage in the evolution of the belt. Some of the larger intrusions in the belt (e.g., the Bonds Range porphyry; 500.4 +/- 0.8 Ma) were emplaced contemporaneously with VHMS deposit formation; however, other bodies such as the Murchison granite (497.3 +/- 0.9 Ma) are younger than the deposits and are unlikely to have been involved in their genesis as has previously been suggested. These conclusions will aid explorers in targeting VHMS mineralization in the Mount Read Volcailics.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Merapi volcano is among the most hazardous volcanoes on the planet. Ancient Javanese folklore describes Merapi's activity as the interaction between the Spirit Kings that inhabit the volcano and the Queen of the South Sea, who resides at Parangtritis beach, 50km SSE of Merapi. The royal palace in Yogyakarta is located half-way along the hypothetical line between Merapi and Parangtritis (the Merapi-Kraton-South Sea axis) to bring balance between these mystical forces. In 2006 and 2010, Merapi erupted explosively and on both occasions, earthquakes shook the region and the eruptions grew more violent in response. These earthquakes appear to influence the sub-volcanic magma supply of Merapi and a positive feedback loop has recently been postulated between the volcano and local earthquake patterns. The 2006 earthquakes clustered along the Opak River fault to the south of the volcano, which trends NE-SW, and reaches the southern sea at Parangtritis beach, the fabled residence of the Queen of the South Sea. Our interpretation of the Merapi-Kraton-South Sea axis is that local folklore was used by ancient people to describe and rationalize the complex interplay between geological processes. We suggest that Merapi displayed volcano-earthquake interaction many times in the past, and not only during its most recent eruptive cycle. Although now shrouded in mystery, these oral traditions can be thought of as an ancient hazard mitigation tool, which makes them likely useful in helping to foster effective dialogues with a variety of target parties and interest groups around the volcano's slopes.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The East China Sea basins, located in the West Pacific Continental Margin (WPCM) since the late Mesozoic, mainly include the East China Sea Shelf Basin (ECSSB) and the Okinawa Trough (OT). The WPCM and its adjacent seas can be tectonically divided into five units from west to east, including the Min-Zhe Uplift, ECSSB, the Taiwan-Sinzi Belt, OT, and the Ryukyu Island Arc, which record regional tectonic evolution and geodynamics. Among those tectonic units, the ECSSB and the OT are important composite sedimentary pull-apart basins, which experienced two stages of strike-slip pull-apart processes. In seismic profiles, the ECSSB and the OT show a double-layer architecture with an upper half-graben overlapping on a lower graben. In planar view, the ECSSB and the OT are characterized by faulted blocks from south to north in the early Cenozoic and by a zonation from west to east in the late Cenozoic. The faulted blocks with planar zonation and two-layer vertical architecture entirely jumped eastward from the Min-Zhe Uplift to the OT during the late Cenozoic. In addition, the whole palaeogeomorphology of the ECSSB changed notably, from pre-Cenozoic highland or mountain into a Late Eocene continental margin with east-tilting topography caused by the eastward tectonic jumping. The OT opened to develop into a back-arc basin until the Miocene. Synthetic surface geological studies in the China mainland reveal that the Mesozoic tectonic setting of the WPCM is an Andean-type continental margin developing many sinistral strike-slip faults and pull-apart basins and the Cenozoic tectonic setting of the WPCM is a Japanese-type continental margin developing dextral strike-slip faults and pull-apart basins. Thus, the WPCM underwent a transition from Andean-type to Japanese-type continental margins at about 80Ma (Late Cretaceous) and a transition in topography from a Mesozoic highland to a Cenozoic lowland, and then to below sea-level basins.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Calcare di Base Formation is a part of the Rossano Basin characterizing the Foreland Basin System of northeastern Calabria. Messinian argillaceous marls from the Calcare di Base Formation have been studied to characterize the sedimentary evolution of this formation during the post-orogenic phases of the Calabria-Peloritani Arc. The mineralogical assemblage of the argillaceous marls is dominated by phyllosilicates (illite, chlorite, illite/smectite mixed layers and traces of kaolinite), carbonate minerals (calcite, aragonite and dolomite), quartz and traces of feldspars (both K-feldspars and plagioclase), gypsum and celestine. The palaeoweathering index records changes at the source, reflecting variations in the tectonic regime as shown in the A-CN-K plot, where the studied samples describe a trend typical of a source area in which active tectonism allows erosion of all zones within weathering profiles developed on source rocks. The studied samples are derived from an environment in which non-steady-state weathering conditions prevailed. This trend could record deformational events that affected the Mediterranean area during the Miocene. The Th/Sc versus Zr/Sc ratios and Al-Zr-Ti plot suggest that the samples likely record a recycling effect from their basement rocks. The geochemical proxies of these samples suggest a provenance from a mainly felsic source. The Messinian argillaceous marls record that deposition probably occurred in a semi-closed marine environment mainly subject to hypersalinity with local episodes of meteoric water influx, during a period characterized by persistent dry and warm/arid conditions alternating with relatively wet conditions.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Early Palaeozoic Shuanggou ophiolite is the best-preserved part of the Ailaoshan ophiolite belt. The microgabbros (basaltic dykes) and basalts (basaltic lavas) show distinct characteristics in geochemistry, implying that their genetic mechanisms are different. With Al2O3 contents ranging from 14.7% to 17.0%, the microgabbros belong to low-alumina type. They exhibit normal mid-ocean-ridge basalt (N-MORB) -like trace elemental characteristics with positive epsilon(Nd)(t) values (9.7-11.6) and slightly variable (Sr-87/Sr-86)(i) ratios (0.7036-0.7046). In contrast, the basalts have high Al2O3 contents (19.5-23.2%), therefore belonging to high-alumina type. A plagioclase-accumulation model is used to account for the high alumina contents. Moreover, the basalts have enriched MORB (E-MORB) -like trace element characteristics with lower epsilon(Nd)(t) values (6.4-8.0) and (Sr-87/Sr-86)(i) ratios (0.7032-0.7036). Their incompatible element ratios exhibit linear correlation with the isotopic data, which is probably related to the contribution of a mixed lithosphere-asthenosphere source. In summary, a two-stage model is proposed to explain the formation of the Shuanggou ophiolite: (1) at the continent-ocean transition stage, the basalts were generated by low-degree partial melting of the mixed mantle near a slow-spreading embryonic centre; and (2) at the mature stage of the Ailaoshan Ocean, the microgabbros were produced by moderate-degree partial melting of the depleted asthenospheric mantle.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Palaeozoic rocks of the Dingle Peninsula provide a record of the evolution of the Caledonides, Acadides and Variscides. The succession ranges from Early Ordovician deep-water sediments, through Silurian shallow marine to non-marine sediments and volcanic rocks to an Old Red Sandstone (ORS) succession topped by Carboniferous marine shales. Comparison of structural styles in the unconformity-bounded groups, together with a detailed analysis of fault zones, allows the tectonic history to be deduced. The older rocks record Caledonian processes on the margin of Avalonia during Early Ordovician time and convergence then soft collision with Laurentia during Silurian time. The Dingle Basin was developed during the late Silurian -Early Devonian transtension in the Iapetus suture zone and was inverted in the latest Emsian Acadian orogenic episode. Post-Dingle Group ORS groups in the north of the peninsula were deposited in a syn-rift footwall block to the main Munster Basin. The Acadian transpressional and Munster Basin extensional structures were reactivated or overprinted in the Variscan deformation such that Acadian folds are transected by Variscan cleavage in both plan and vertical views. After Iapetus closure, changes in the tectonic regime are believed to be a result of adjustments in the geometry of subduction of the Rheic Ocean.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The olistostromes form two belts within the Pieniny Klippen Belt (PKB) in the Northern Carpathians. They mark an early stage of the development of the accretionary prism. The first belt was formed during Late Cretaceous time as a result of subduction of the southern part of the Alpine Tethys. The fore-arc basin originated along this subduction zone, with synorogenic flysch deposits. Huge olistoliths deposited within the Cretaceous-Palaeogene flysch of the Zlatne Basin, presently located in the vicinity of the Haligovce village (eastern Slovakia), provide a good example of the fore-arc olistostrome setting. The second belt is related to the movement of the accretionary prism, which overrode the Czorsztyn Ridge during Late Cretaceous-Paleocene time. The destruction of this ridge led to the formation of submarine slumps and olistoliths along the southern margin of the Magura Basin. The Upper Cretaceous -Paleocene flysch sequences of the Magura Basin constitute the matrix of olistostromes. The large Homole block in the Jaworki village represents the best example of the Magura Basin olistolith. Numerous examples of olistoliths were documented in western Slovakia, Poland, eastern Slovakia and Ukraine. The olistostromes formed within the Zlatne and Magura basins orginated during the tectonic process, forming the olistostrome belts along the strike of the PKB structure.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>A puzzling, slightly submerged, single tidal notch has been reported from the carbonate coasts of the northeastern Adriatic Sea. This paper attempts to explain the origin and the recent evolution of this marine erosion feature and the reasons for its uniqueness in the late Holocene. After reviewing how tidal notches are usually formed, a comparison of recent measurements of bioerosion rates carried out in the area show that when the contribution of dissolution processes can be neglected, bioerosion rates of the deepening of tidal-notch profiles appear to be very low (often &lt;0.1 mm/y) along the coasts of Istria, in contrast to higher rates (between 0.2 and 1.0 mm/y) generally reported in other Mediterranean areas. Such a low rate of bioerosion implies a long period favourable to tidal-notch development. Several glacial isostatic adjustment computations show that relative sea level changes in the area during the last few millennia may correspond to a period of equilibrium between the regional tectonic subsidence and hydro-isostatic emergence during which relative sea level changes were limited, permitting development of the tidal notch observed. The submergence of the notch is consistent with a coseismic subsidence in late Roman time. After this, a new tidal notch could not form at the present sea level because of the limited amount of local bioerosion and the relatively large rate of sea level rise.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>After more than half a century of research, the dynamics of salt tectonics in the North Sea remains a contentious issue with unresolved questions regarding triggering and driving mechanisms. The North Sea is now covered by high-quality 3D seismic datasets which allow new insights into the interplay between salt tectonics and sedimentation. These insights are of both regional geological, societal and exploration interest as well as more widely applicable as analogues for salt tectonics in frontier regions such as the South Atlantic salt basins. A high quality 3D seismic volume from the Netherlands North Sea is used to show the thick and mobile Zechstein halite sequence of Late Permian age remobilized in several phases into complex salt structures. Early stage structural evolution was dominated by Triassic NNE-SSW and NW-SE trending salt ridges. Salt tectonic reorganization was triggered by regional shortening in the Campanian. Salt was transferred both laterally and vertically, creating salt anticlines and tall asymmetrical salt diapirs. Vertical growth of the tallest salt diapirs continued in pulses in the Plio-Pleistocene likely driven by increased sediment input from southern North Sea delta systems. The most recent deformation affects Late Pleistocene and Holocene sediment and could have impacted on the landscapes of Meso-Lithic human occupied sites. The recent activity of some salt domes should be considered when planning repositories for gas and nuclear waste. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Understanding the provenance of the reservoir in a sedimentary basin is of great importance in hydrocarbon exploration and production. The Yinggehai-Song Hong Basin is one of the most important Cenozoic petroliferous basins in the South China Sea. To better understand the provenance characteristics of the Upper Miocene Huangliu Formation (Tortonian-Messinian) on the eastern margin of the basin and test the influence of uplift of the Tibetan Plateau in the South China Sea, 172 single zircons from two sandstone samples in the Lingtou gas field were dated by U-Pb chronometer, and 54 of these grains were spot analyzed for Hf isotopes. The results indicate that the upper member of the Huangliu Formation in this gas field shows two major peaks of U-Pb ages at ca. 250 Ma and ca. 432 Ma, along with four subordinate peaks at ca. 757 Ma, ca. 1926 Ma, ca. 2529 Ma and ca. 2775 Ma. The initial Hf isotope ratios [epsilon(Hf)(t)] of these zircons are negative to positive for each age group, suggesting that existing crustal materials were mixing with new mantle melts in some magmatic episodes. In contrast, the lower member of the Huangliu Formation show two major age peaks at ca. 98 Ma and 248 Ma, with a subordinate peak at ca. 1453 Ma. The epsilon Hf(t) values are concentrated between -11.6 and -3.4, revealing that they were derived from older crust. Comparing with the source characteristics of tectonic units surrounding the basin, the source of the upper member in the gas field was mainly from the southern Yangtze Block, whereas the lower member was derived from the Hainan Uplift. Together with the change of climate and sedimentation rate after 10 Ma on the northern margin of the South China Sea, we attribute the provenance change to the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau at the same time.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This study is based on the geological interpretation of 250 km(2) of multibeam bathymetric data coupled with 300 km of seismic profiles recorded on the northern shelf of the Marmara Sea offshore Buyuk double dagger ekmece and KuA A1/4k double dagger ekmece Lagoons. The sea bottom morphology has a highly chaotic structure at the exit of the Buyuk double dagger ekmece and KuA A1/4k double dagger ekmece lagoons. This chaotic surface structure is controlled by a basin-ridge system lying in the NE-SW direction at the exit of the Buyuk double dagger ekmece Lagoon and by a relatively deep entrance observed at the exit of the KuA A1/4k double dagger ekmece Lagoon. In addition, the linear submarine slope parallel to the shoreline between the Istanbul Strait and the KuA A1/4k double dagger ekmece Lagoon is an important morphological structure of this area. The Istanbul Strait's canyon on the northern shelf of the Marmara Sea and the elevated submarine plain west of this canyon are other important morphological structures observed at the sea bottom. The geologic interpretation of seismic profiles has allowed us to distinguish two seismo-stratigraphic units. The lower one is separated from the overlying units by a seismic sequence having a seismic facies from chaotic to parallel and the top represented by a high amplitude seismic reflector. Since these units get close to the sea bottom rising landwards, they are inferred to be the seaward continuation of the Oligocene-Upper Miocene units widely exposed on land. The upper unit, overlying the acoustic basement, whose parallel internal reflections onlap and downlap on the top of the acoustic basement, is interpreted as a Quaternary basin fill. Two groups of faults have been identified on seismic profiles and identified based on their characteristics in the study area. The first group consists of dip-slip faults trending NNE-SSW. These faults border the western slope of the Bosporus and the NNE-SSW trending basins offshore of the Buyuk double dagger ekmece Lagoon. The second group of faults consists of NW-SE oriented strike-slip faults. These faults have created the linearities in the same direction at the sea bottom. As the result of comparison of these NW-SE-faults to the North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAFZ), this group of faults is likely to have a relation with the NAFZ. Therefore, it is considered that the mentioned faults may be reactivated in the region due to the stress created by the NAFZ.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The central depression of the Qiongdongnan Basin can be divided into the eastern and western sub-basins by the Lingshui-Songnan paleo-uplift. To the northwest, the orientation of the faults turns from NE, to EW, and later to NW; In the southwest, the orientation of the faults turns from NE, to NNE, and then to NW, making the central depression much wider towards the west. In the eastern sub-basin, the NE-striking faults and the EW-striking faults made up an echelon, making the central depression turn wider towards the east. Fault activity rates indicate that faulting spreads gradually from both the east and west sides to the middle of the basin. Hence, extensional stress in the eastern sub-basin may be related to the South China Sea spreading system, whereas the western sub-basin was more under the effect of the activity of the Red River Fault. The extreme crustal stretching in the eastern sub-basin was probably related to magmatic setting. It seems that there are three periods of magmatic events that occurred in the eastern sub-basin. In the eastern part of the southern depression, the deformed strata indicate that the magma may have intruded into the strata along faults around T60 (23.3 Ma). The second magmatic event occurred earlier than 10.5 Ma, which induced the accelerated subsidence. The final magmatic event commenced later than 10 Ma, which led to today's high heat flow. As for the western sub-basin, the crust thickened southward, and there seemed to be a southeastward lower crustal flow, which happened during continental breakup which was possibly superimposed by a later lower crustal flow induced by the isostatic compensation of massive sedimentation caused by the right lateral slipping of the Red River Fault. Under the huge thick sediment, super pressure developed in the western sub-basin. In summary, the eastern sub-basin was mainly affected by the South China Sea spreading system and a magma setting, whereas the western sub-basin had a closer relationship with the Indo-China extrusion system.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Selected high-resolution seismic-reflection profiles and multibeam bathymetry acquired along the convergent Ecuador margin during the ATACAMES cruise on onboard the R/V L'Atalante (Jan.15-Feb.18, 2012) allow a preliminary evaluation of the neotectonic development and stratigraphic evolution of the margin based on the sismo-stratigraphic analysis of Quaternary sediment preserved on the margin shelf and upper slope. We present three major preliminary results. (1) The evolution of the Esmeraldas, Guayaquil and Santa Elena canyons. The head of the Esmeraldas canyon is the location of a continuous significant sediment transport. The Guayaquil canyon shows several episodes of deposition and incision. Aggrading sedimentation pattern in the canyon records several changes in relative sea-level. The subsidence of the Gulf of Guayaquil probably contributes to the good preservation of the canyon filling stages. The Santa Elena canyon is controlled by a SW-NE trending normal fault. (2) Variations of sediment accumulation and relative vertical motions are shown along-strike the shelf edge. Offshore the uplifted Manta peninsula, a pronounced subsidence of the shelf edge is documented by sedimentary clinoforms that have deposited in a morphological reentrant, and have migrated upslope testifying of a local subsidence meanwhile the adjacent La Plata Island area underwent uplift. In the Esmeraldas canyon area, a local uplift of the shelf is documented. (3) Two neotectonic fault systems with a possible transcurrent component are imaged across the shelf edge and upper margin slope offshore Jama, and Cape Galera. This possible transcurrent motion could be related to the reactivation of ancient faults of the upper plate by the subduction. These preliminary results indicate that the ATACAMES data set has a strong potential to evaluate the spatial and temporal contribution of tectonic and climate changes on the structural development and stratigraphic evolution of the Ecuador continental margin.</td>

Seismic investigations were performed along three refraction and wide-angle reflection seismic lines. Integrated with gravity data the seismic data were used to determine the structure of the oceanic crust, the transition between continent and ocean (COT), and the continental structures down to the lithosphere-asthenosphere system (LAB). We demonstrate how modeling of multiple water waves can be used to determine the sound velocity in oceanic water along a seismic refraction profile. Our 2D seismic and density models documents 4-9 km thick oceanic crust formed at the Knipovich Ridge, a distinct and narrow continent-ocean transition (COT), the Caledonian suture zone between Laurentia and Barentsia, and 30-35 km thick continental crust beneath the Barents Sea. The COT west of southern Spitsbergen expresses significant excess density (more than 0.1 g/cm(3) in average), which is characteristic for mafic/ultramafic and high-grade metamorphic rocks. The results of the gravity modeling show relatively weak correlation of the density with seismic velocity in the upper mantle, which suggests that the horizontal differences between oceanic and continental mantle are dominated by mineralogical changes, although a thermal effect is also present. The seismic velocity change with depth suggests lherzolite composition of the uppermost oceanic mantle, and dunite composition beneath the continental crust. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Shallow marine carbonate sedimentation prevailed during the Early Triassic in the northern part of the Persian Gulf (Kangan Formation; offshore Iran). Associated near surface and (to a lesser extent) burial diagenesis had significant impacts on the evolution of reservoir properties of the Kangan Formation. In some Iranian offshore fields such as Salman, pervasive, early dolomitization of the Kangan carbonate rocks is believed to have played an important role in improving the reservoir characteristics of this unit. Detailed petrographic and geochemical analyses indicate that such dolomitization could be explained by means of the sabkha/seepage-reflux model. Furthermore, three types of dolomites, found in Kangan rocks in the Salman Field, have been described: (1) fabric-retentive, (2) fabric-destructive, and (3) cement. Fabric-retentive dolomites are the most frequent commonly found in the studied field, with respect to the other types. Oxygen and carbon-stable isotopic analyses confirm that the fabric-retentive dolomites and associated anhydrites formed at surface and near-surface conditions, whereas the fabric-destructive dolomite formed at temperatures above 50 degrees C. The burial history of the Salman Field is divided into three major phases (tectonic quiescence and low subsidence rates, and two active phases with high subsidence rates). The fabric-retentive dolomites are mostly related to the first phase, while the fabric-destructive and dolomite cements are related to the second and third phases including shallow and deep burial, respectively.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This study examines the neotectonic deformation and development of the Tromen massif, a Quaternary retroarc volcanic field located in the western section of the Malargue fold and thrust belt in the Southern Central Andes. The linkages between neotectonic deformation in the intra-arc zone and the recent retroarc structures of the Tromen volcanic plateau are not clearly understood. These retroarc deformations affect the mid-section of the fold and thrust belt, leaving to the east a 200 km-wide deformed zone that can be considered inactive over the last 12-10 Ma. This out-of-sequence deformation west of the orogenic front area has not been previously addressed in detail. In this study, exhaustive mapping is used to describe and discriminate structures with a neotectonic component from those fossilized by Pleistocene strata. Two balanced cross-sections are constructed showing the distribution of the youngest deformations and their relation to pre-Miocene structures. An important means for evaluating this is the morphometric and morphological analyses that allowed identification of perturbations in the fluvial network associated with active structures. In a broader perspective, neotectonic activity in the fold and thrust belt is discussed and inferred to be caused by local mechanical weakening of the retroarc zone, due to injection of asthenospheric material evidenced by magnetotelluric surveys. Thus, deformation imposed by the oblique convergence between South American and Nazca plates, while to the south being limited to the Liquine-Ofqui fault system that runs through the arc zone, in the retroarc area is located at the site of magmatic emplacement, presumably in association with a thermally weakened-upper crust. This control exemplifies the relationship that exists between surficial processes, magmatic emplacement and upper asthenospheric dynamics in the Southern Central Andes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Up to now, all the high-grade gneisses of the Korean peninsula have been regarded as Precambrian basement rocks and presence of the Phanerozoic high-grade metamorphic rocks have remained unknown. However, such granite gneiss is discovered through this study from the central Yeongnam massif near Gimcheon. SHRIMP zircon U-Pb age determinations on the granite gneiss, having well-developed gneissic foliations and migmatitic textures, reveal concordant age of ca. 250 Ma indicating the Early Triassic emplacement of this pluton, which is in contradict to the previous belief that it is a Precambrian product. Even though the granite gneiss reveals well-developed gneissic foliations and some zircons show rather low Th/U ratios, the metamorphic age has not been determined successfully. However, the age of metamorphism can be constrained as middle Triassic considering the absence of any evidences of metamorphism from the nearby granitic plutons having emplacement ages of ca. 225 Ma. Early Triassic emplacement and subsequent Middle Triassic metamorphism of the granite gneiss from the Yeongnam massif bear a remarkable resemblance to the case of South China block. We suggest the possibility that Early to Middle Triassic metamorphism of the Korean peninsula might be products of the intracontinental collisional events not directly related with the Early Triassic continental collision event.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>AimAlthough all five of the major mediterranean-climate ecosystems (MCEs) of the world are recognized as loci of high plant species diversity and endemism, they show considerable variation in regional-scale richness. Here, we assess the role of stable Pleistocene climate and Cenozoic topography in explaining variation in regional richness of the globe's MCEs. We hypothesize that older, more climatically stable MCEs would support more species, because they have had more time for species to accumulate than MCEs that were historically subject to greater topographic upheavals and fluctuating climates.
   <br>LocationSouth-western Africa (Cape), south-western Australia, California, central Chile and the eastern (Greece) and western (Spain) Mediterranean Basin.
   <br>MethodsWe estimated plant diversity for each MCE as the intercepts of species-area curves that are homogeneous in slope across all regions. We used two down-scaled global circulation models of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to quantify climate stability by comparing the change in the location of MCEs between the LGM and present. We quantified the Cenozoic topographic stability of each MCE by comparing contemporary topographic profiles with those present in the late Oligocene and the early Pliocene.
   <br>ResultsThe most diverse MCEs - Cape and Australia - had the highest Cenozoic environmental stability, and the least diverse - Chile and California - had the lowest stability.
   <br>Main conclusionsVariation in plant diversity in MCEs is likely to be a consequence not of differences in diversification rates, but rather the persistence of numerous pre-Pliocene clades in the more stable MCEs. The extraordinary plant diversity of the Cape is a consequence of the combined effects of both mature and recent radiations, the latter associated with increased habitat heterogeneity produced by mild tectonic uplift in the Neogene.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The current topography of Central Asia is considered to have resulted from crustal shortening related to the ongoing India-Asia collision that started in the Early Tertiary period. The Bogeda Shan, a northeastern branch of the Tian Shan located in northwest China, has several summits higher than 5000 m. The northern piedmont of the Bogeda Shan exhibits remarkable deformation features that remain poorly studied. This study documents three phases of tectonic deformation in the Bogeda Shan that are related to the far-field effects of collisions along the southern Eurasian margin. Detailed field observations show that the intensively folded Upper Permian strata are covered by a subhorizontal Lower Jurassic layer, thus indicating a Triassic tectonic event that is probably related to the onset of the uplift in the Bogeda Shan during a Cimmerian orogenic episode (D-1). A seismic profile suggests that this deformation episode was followed by the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous deformation (D-2), which is characterized by wide wavelength folds overlaid by undeformed Cretaceous layers. Cenozoic thrusts were also observed in the northern piedmont of the Bogeda Shan (D-3). This study demonstrates that the onset of uplift in the Bogeda Shan began in the Early Mesozoic and separated the Turfan-Hami Basin from the Junggar Basin. A new tectonic evolution model of the Bogeda Shan was reconstructed by these three tectonic phases. This work indicates that the current topography of the Bogeda Shan and its surrounding area was the result of multiple phases of deformation related to successive collisions at the southern Eurasian margin.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This contribution reports the basin configuration feature, stratigraphy and sedimentary architecture of the Lishu Depression in the Songliao Basin, China. The activity rate, distribution and style of local faulting demonstrate the timing and extent of regional rifting. Distinct episodes of compressional tectonic activity caused uplift and exposure of strata evident as the traditional syn- and post-rift stages of basin evolution. These episodes led to the sequential denudation of the Upper Jurassic Huoshiling Formation, Lower Cretaceous Yingcheng and Denglouku Formations, and corresponding regional unconformities. Acting in tandem with regional compression, activity along the major boundary faults influenced the evolving basin configuration, as well as seismic sequences and sedimentary patterns. Seismic, well log and drill core data described here show subdivision sections of the Lishu Depression strata according to discrete phases of the traditional syn-rift stage of deposition. We refer to these sub-stages as the initial rifting, the intensive rifting and the recession phases. The basin configuration shifted from a graben/half-graben configuration during the initial rifting phase, to a dustpan-shaped half-graben pattern during the subsequent phase of intensive rifting, and finally into a gentle sedimentary basin during the final recession phase. The early seismic sequence divides into a lowstand systems tract (LST), transgressive systems tract (TST) and high-stand systems tract (HST). Evidence of the LST within the seismic sequence becomes less apparent with the intensive rifting phase, while the HST occupied an increasing proportion of the section. The shallow water depositional fill formed during the final recession phase consists only of TST and HST components. Depositional environment then shifts from alluvial fan and shallow lacustrine systems to fan delta, braided delta - lake, and finally to a braided fluvial setting. The vertical stacking pattern shifts from retrogradational, to progradational, to aggradational. Identification of sub-structural units and interpretation of their genetic relationships helps clarify basin evolution, and thus serves larger-scale continental basin analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The bay and its surroundings locate in a very complex fault system. In the scope of this study, the results belonging to GPS and gravity studies within a wide line including Izmir Gulf in the north, beginning from Sigacik Bay, have been examined.
   <br>In this study, in order to control tectonic settlements of the area, horizontal and vertical derivative methods have been applied to Bouguer gravity data. Additionally, horizontal and vertical velocities have been calculated from GPS studies in the same region to define the movement characteristic of the Sigacik Bay and its vicinity.
   <br>As a result, all findings obtained from gravity and GPS studies have been assessed together. An approach has been developed for the geodynamic structure controlling the seismic activity of the region by examining obtained findings with seismological data. Obtained results indicated that the both gravity and GPS methods are useful for defining the tectonically displacement in vertical and horizontal direction and as result of all findings deep structural sources in the region presents itself as a mechanism with two different directions, namely north-west and north-east, in the land beginning from Sigacik Bay.

Here we employ the H-k stacking technique and depth domain receiver function to constrain the crustal thickness and P- and S-wave velocity ratio as well as the upper mantle discontinuity. Our results identify the signature of slab break-off and lower crustal delamination in southern Tibet, which might have induced the mantle upwelling and crustal melting. The convergence of the Indian plate inducing northward crustal flow might be a major factor that contributes to the uplift and crustal thickening of Tibet. We also evaluate the E-W trending cumulative compression as another dominant factor that contributes to the increase in crustal thickness in the northern Tibet. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The key goals to studying submarine landslides and associated tsunamis are to better assess the magnitude information of palaeo-tsunamis and to contribute to assessing future tsunami risks. The numerical modelling of submarine landslides and the tsunamis thus generated comprises important interdisciplinary research that requires knowledge of both geology and numerical modelling. Models are capable of delineating the time evolution of tsunami hydrodynamics, sediment transport, and the resulting morphological changes associated with deposition. To advance towards the ultimate goal of improved tsunami risk assessment, modellers and geologists need to develop an in-depth mutual understanding of the advantages, limitations, and uncertainties in both numerical modelling and geological records. In this work, seafloor features related to former submarine landslides in the Alboran Sea basin have been identified through multibeam bathymetry data and high- to very high-resolution seismic profiles. The mathematical modelling and hindcasting have been performed through numerical simulation of a hypothetical submarine landslide and the associated tsunami that could have originated one of the submarine landslides identified. This system, on the southern Alboran Ridge slope, is currently reworked by turbidite processes, forming a submarine canyon-sedimentary fan system known as the Al-Borani System. The HySEA numerical model simulates the submarine landslide triggering the tsunami and the water mass evolution, wave propagation, and the final penetration of the tsunami waves onto the coast, reproducing initial and subsequent tsunami wave impacts by means of a single coupled numerical model. This numerical model allows an analysis of the influence of basin morphology on the tsunami propagation features, such as shape and propagation patterns, speed or wave amplitude and, finally, its impact on the coast (in this case South Iberia and North Africa). This model can also be used as a prediction tool for the simulation of potential landslides, many of which generate tsunamis. Monitoring of critical areas, where landslides are more probable, and modelling their consequences will allow a choice of the appropriate mitigation strategies. Therefore, monitoring and modelling are areas of key scientific and socio-economic interests. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Yinggehai and Qiongdongnan basins in the northwestern South China Sea preserve a large volume of Cenozoic sediments. However, their sources are still barely understood. In this paper, we combine rare earth element (BEE) geochemistry, heavy mineral analysis and detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology for samples from potential source areas and basin boreholes to explore the Late Miocene source-to-sink system. Our reconstructed model reveals that the Upper Miocene sediments were supplied from nonunique sources. Hainan Island mainly controlled the supply to the outer shelf, resulting in the relatively high REE concentration, zircon-tourmaline-rutile (ZTR) index and the Yanshanian zircon U-Pb ages. By contrast, sediments from the northern Yinggehai Basin show a lower REE concentration and the assemblage of garnet, magnetite, epidote, amphibole and staurolite, suggesting the influence of metamorphic rocks along the Red River Fault Zone. Despite the geological data shortage in Central Vietnam, it may still be distinguished from the other provenances in the Central Depression of the Yinggehai Basin where is characterized by little metamorphic minerals and the relatively low ZTR index. It is noteworthy that sediments in the Central Depression of the Qiongdongnan Basin are distinct from those offshore Hainan Island in terms of each provenance proxy. We interpret that these sediments probably were transported from the southeastern Yinggehai Basin through the submarine canyon. The relative sea level fall during the late Miocene and the structural inversion in the northern Yinggehai Basin could together facilitate this long-distance sediment transport. The local mafic volcanism is also found in the Qiongdongnan Basin, as indicated by the Eu enrichment and the mineral group of augite and olivine. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>A sediment core from Pariyaj Lake, from the Vatrak River basin, located at the desert margin in the Gujarat Alluvial Plains of western India, was investigated in a multidisciplinary aspect. The goal was to reconstruct the palaeoclimate, palaeoenvironment and tectonic history and to understand the role these factors played in the geomorphological evolution of the area during the Holocene. Palaeoclimatic interpretations also shed light on the factors responsible for the rise and fall of the Harappan civilisation. The results obtained based on multiproxy studies show five climatic phases during the last 11,000 yr BP. Phase 1 (similar to 11,000 cal yr BP) represents a very humid climate and high precipitation/discharge leading to high lake stand as attested by the high pollen concentration of semi-evergreen tree taxa, phytoliths belonging to cool and moist grasses, and large proportion of algae, marking the onset of Holocene. In phase 2 (similar to 8000 to 9000 cal yr BP) a significantly reduced yield of pollen, phytoliths and aquatic algae indicates shrinkage of the lake. Phase 3 (similar to 7630 cal yr BP) shows moderate yield of pollen and phytolith pointing towards fluctuating precipitation conditions. Phase 4 (similar to 5864 to 4680 cal yr BP) shows very low pollen and phytolith counts, indicating a very dry spell. Finally, phase 5 (similar to 4680 to 3500 cal yr BP) shows a good density and diversity of flora. The wet climate and high lake stand similar to 11,000 cal yr BP, 7630 cal yr BP and after similar to 4680 cal yr BP are synchronous with the lacustrine, marine and aeolian records of western India. The contribution of winter precipitation at 7630 cal yr BP and after similar to 4680 cal yr BP can be correlated with similar records from Rajasthan Lake. Decrease in the precipitation activity, the low lake stand and the onset of dry climatic condition between 8000 and 9000 cal yr BP corresponds to a near global anomaly of this period. Another dry event between similar to 5864 and 4680 cal yr BP documented in Pariyaj Lake record is synchronous with various proxy records of the mid-late Holocene Afro-Asiatic monsoonal belt.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>A newly discovered Precambrian basement of the External Hellenides (Peloponnesus) is composed of mica schist, quartzite and meta-greywackes intruded by Cambrian granitoids (524+61-5 Ma). As such Cambrian intrusions are frequent in the eastern Mediterranean, but are lacking in northern Africa, they are interpreted to result from a Cadomian magmatic arc that was situated along the northern margin of East Gondwana. This arc was rifted off from Gondwana in Early Paleozoic times. The sedimentation age of the meta-greywackes is bracketed between the age of their youngest detrital zircons (541 +/- 7 Ma, Crete; 546 +/- 7 Ma, Peloponnesus) and the intrusion of the Cambrian granitoids. The detrital zircon age spectra are dominated by two significant age peaks at ca. 600 Ma and ca. 1 Ga, which are characteristic for Cambrian platform sediments of Jordan, Israel and Lybia and for the Minoan-type terranes with an East Gondwana provenance. The high amount of 1 Ga old zircons points to a Tonian basement as provenance, which is situated at the northern margin of the Arabian Nubian Shield (N'Sinai) and the Sahara Metacraton, today hidden under Mesozoic cover. There is a good correlation between the detrital age spectra of the Late Ediacaran/Cambrian basement of the External Hellenides and of the eastern Mediterranean realm. Apart from the Hellenides and Turkey (Menderes, Sakarya), the Minoan-type terranes have also been found in Sicily, Sardinia, and NW Iberia. Our review of detrital zircon ages obtained from Europe and northern Africa revealed four different domains during Early Cambrian times, which have affinities to (1) Baltica, (2) South-America (Avalonian-type terranes), (3) W Africa (Armorican-type terranes), and (4) E Gondwana (Minoan-type terranes and the platform sandstones of E Africa).

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In this paper we present new U-Pb zircon age, Sm-Nd isotopic and chemical composition data for rocks cropping out in a few isolated nunataks in Wilhelm II Land in East Antarctica, namely Mirny oasis, Mt Brown and Gaussberg volcano, which contains xenogenic crustal material. These outcrops were subjects of geological investigations during the Soviet Antarctic Expedition of 1956-1957. Our data show that this region is underlain by a uniform crust which experienced a high-grade metamorphic event at ca 980-920 Ma, co-eval with the Rayner Orogeny in Kemp Land and the northern Prince Charles Mountains. Extensive indications of a ca 500 Ma event in coastal areas (granitoid intrusions in Mirny oasis and inherited zircons found in Gaussberg volcano), together with the lack of indications of this age in Mt Brown, point to a concentration of ca 500 Ma processes (roughly co-eval with the Prydz Orogeny) in the coastal part of Wilhelm II Land and their attenuation inland. We also determined a ca 1480 Ma age for a mafic magmatic protolith in Mt Brown which may be correlated with roughly co-eval orthogneiss in the Bunger Hills area. These observations suggest the conjugate positions of these crustal blocks in the early Mesoproterozoic and argue against a Cambrian suture running between them. In Gaussberg volcano a range of zircon Pb-206/U-238 ages of ca 320 Ma, ca 500 Ma, ca 980 Ma, and ca 2000-1800 Ma has been determined. The presence of ca 2000-1800 Ma zircons indicates involvement of mid-Palaeoproterozoic rocks in the structure of Wilhelm II Land. This argues for possible conjugation of this region with other East Antarctic blocks experienced the Palaeoproterozoic tectonic evolution and which have been considered to comprise the Mawson palaeocontinent.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The similar to 2.7 Ga Veligallu greenstone terrane in the eastern Dharwar craton is one of the least studied Neoarchean greenstone belts in India. To our knowledge, there is no published dataset that provides a detailed account of the petrogenetic processes, which culminated into the evolution of this greenstone belt. This paper presents a comprehensive account of field, petrography and geochemistry of the basalt-high-Mg andesite-adakitic volcanic rock association in the Veligallu greenstone belt.
   <br>The basalts are tholeiitic in nature and are characterized by primitive geochemical compositions with similar to 49 wt% Si02, similar to 9 wt% MgO, Mg# 54, Cr similar to 197 ppm, Ni similar to 122 ppm, Y similar to 27 ppm, Yb similar to 2.7 ppm; Zr/Y &lt; 3 and Ce/Yb &lt;5. They do not plot on a mixing line between Mesoarchean TIG and N-MORB, therefore, inconsistent with any interaction with the upper continental crust. Accordingly, they are interpreted to have erupted in an oceanic setting. On the basis of Nb/Th ratio the Veligallu basalts are divided onto two groups. The basalts with Nb/Th &gt; 8 display systematically flat to light-REE depleted chondrite normalized REE patterns (La-N/Yb-N = 0.76-1.0), in contrast to the samples with Nb/Th &lt;8, which display 'slight enrichments in light-REE (La-N/Yb-N = 1.0-1.6). The depleted basalts are characterized by primitive mantle normalized Nb concentrations lower than La but equal to Th, in contrast to the enriched basalts, which are characterized by slight depletions of Nb relative to both La and Th. Collectively, as a group, they display Nb/Yb ratio higher than the N-MORB. The enrichment in Nb is attributed to moderate to low degree (similar to 10%-4%) partial melting of a depleted MORE source. The trace, REE and their interelement ratios in the Veligallu basalts exhibit transitional characteristics between the average N-MORE and the typical Phanerozoic island arc basalts. Overall, the geochemical characteristics of the Veligallu basalts are identical to basalts erupted in the Phanerozoic back-arc basins.
   <br>The Veligallu high-Mg andesites are orthopyroxene-bearing calc-alkaline andesites and are characterized by moderate SiO2 (similar to 56 wt%), high MgO (similar to 8 wt%), Mg# (61-67), Cr (174-330 ppm) and Ni (173-242 ppm) contents; low Y (similar to 13 ppm) and Yb (similar to 1.2 ppm) concentrations, relative to typical island arc andesites. They exhibit light-REE enriched (La-N/Sm-N similar to 1.7) and heavy-REE depleted (Gd-N/Yb-N similar to 1.9) fractionated REE patterns. On a primitive mantle normalized trace element variation diagram they exhibit negative Nb and Ti, and contrasting positive Zr anomalies relative to the neighboring REE. The La-Yb systematics suggest that these high-Mg andesites were generated by hydrous partial melting of a slab-melt metasomatized mantle wedge in the sub-arc mantle. The felsic volcanic rocks are characterized by high SiO2 similar to 73 wt%, Na2O similar to 4.5 wt%, and significantly low concentrations of MgO (similar to 0.72 wt%), Cr similar to 19 ppm, Ni 23 ppm, Y similar to 5.9, and Yb 0.44 ppm; strongly fractionated chondrite normalized REE patterns (La-N/Yb-N similar to 30) with occasionally minor positive Eu anomaly, and primitive mantle normalized negative Nb and Ti, and contrasting positive Zr anomaly. The geochemical attributes of the Veligallu felsic volcanic rocks are analogous to the Cenozoic high silica-type adakites that are produced by partial melting in the sub-arc mantle, and presumably without any significant interaction of the slab-melts with the overlying mantle wedge.
   <br>The juxtaposed occurrence of basalts with the banded iron formations, and their close spatial association with the high-Mg andesites, in the Veligallu greenstone belt, indicates that the petrogenesis of these volcanic rocks is consistent with their eruption in an intraoceanic setting. The close proximal association of the back-arc type basalts, and the high-Mg andesites and adakites within the Veligallu greenstone belt potentially suggests that this greenstone belt represents a rifted back-arc crust. This event appears to have significantly contributed to the peak of crustal growth activity in the eastern Dharwar craton at 2.7 Ga. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Batang Group (BTG) volcanic rocks in the Zhiduo area, with NW-trending outcrops along the northeastern margin of the Qiangtang terrane (northern Tibet), are mainly composed of volcaniclastic rocks, dacite and rhyolite. Major and trace element, Sr and Nd isotope, zircon U-Pb and Hf isotope data are presented for the BTG dacites. Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry zircon U-Pb dating constrains the timing of volcanic eruption as Late Triassic (221 +/- A 1 Ma). Major and trace element geochemistry shows that the BTG volcanic rocks are classified as calc-alkaline series. All samples are enriched in large-ion lithophile elements and light rare earth elements with negative-slightly positive Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu* = 0.47-1.15), and depleted in high field strength elements and heavy rare earth elements. In addition, these rocks possess less radiogenic Sr [(Sr-87/Sr-86) (i) = 0.7047-0.7078], much radiogenic Nd (epsilon(Nd)(t) = -4.2 to -1.3) and Hf (epsilon(Hf)(t) = 4.0-6.6) isotopes, suggesting that they probably originated from partial melting of a crustal source containing a mantle-derived juvenile component. The inferred magma was assimilated by crustal materials during ascending and experienced significant fractional crystallization. By combining previously published and the new data, we propose that the BTG volcanic rocks were genetically related to southwestward subduction of the Ganzi-Litang ocean (a branch of Paleo-Tethys) in the northeastern margin of the Qiangtang terrane. Given the coeval arc-affinity magmatic rocks in the region, we envisage that the Ganzi-Litang ocean may extend from the Zhongdian arc through the Yidun terrane to the Zhiduo area, probably even further northwest to the Tuotuohe area.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Cotiella Massif in the south-central Pyrenees hosts upper Cretaceous gravity-driven extensional faults which were developed in the Bay of Biscay-Pyrenean paleorift margin of the Atlantic Ocean. They accommodate up to 6 km of post-rift carbonates above relict upper Triassic salt. Subsequent Pyrenean contractional deformation preserved the main extensional features, but most of the upper Triassic salt was expulsed and then dissolved, leaving little indications of the original salt volume. Nonetheless, several distinctive salt-related features are still recognizable both at outcrop and at basin scale, providing an exposed analogue for salt-floored extensional basins developed on passive margins. Based on field research, we re-interpret the tectonic evolution of the area and suggest that passive diapirs were coeval with gravity-driven extension during the development of the Cotiella basin. The given interpretations are supported with detailed geological maps, original structural data, cross sections and outcrop photographs. The discovery of previously unknown post-rift salt structures in the Cotiella Massif is an extra element to consider in the paleogeographic reconstructions of the upper Cretaceous passive margin of the Bay of Biscay-Pyrenean realm and consequently helps in our understanding of the evolution of current Atlantic-type margins.</td>

The carbonate succession consists of hemipelagic, slope and platform margin facies and contains algae and benthic foraminifers indicative of the Tithonian age.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Detailed pedofacies characterization along-with lithofacies investigations of the Mio-Pleistocene Siwalik sediments exposed in the Ramnagar sub-basin have been studied so as to elucidate variability in time and space of fluvial processes and the role of intra- and extra-basinal controls on fluvial sedimentation during the evolution of the Himalayan foreland basin (HFB).
   <br>Dominance of multiple, moderately to strongly developed palaeosol assemblages during deposition of Lower Siwalik (similar to 12-10.8 Ma) sediments suggest that the HFB was marked by Upland set-up of Thomas et al. (2002). Activity of intra-basinal faults on the uplands and deposition of terminal fans at different times caused the development of multiple soils. Further, detailed pedofacies along-with lithofacies studies indicate prevalence of stable tectonic conditions and development of meandering streams with broad floodplains. However, the Middle Siwalik (similar to 10.8-4.92 Ma) sub-group is marked by multistoried sandstones and minor mudstone and mainly weakly developed palaeosols, indicating deposition by large braided rivers in the form of megafans in a Lowland set-up of Thomas et al. (2002). Significant change in nature and size of rivers from the Lower to Middle Siwalik at similar to 10 Ma is found almost throughout of the basin from Kohat Plateau (Pakistan) to Nepal because the Himalayan orogeny witnessed its greatest tectonic upheaval at this time leading to attainment of great heights by the Himalaya, intensification of the monsoon, development of large rivers systems and a high rate of sedimentation, hereby a major change from the Upland set-up to the Lowland set-up over major parts of the HFB.
   <br>An interesting geomorphic environmental set-up prevailed in the Ramnagar sub-basin during deposition of the studied Upper Siwalik (similar to 4.92 to &lt;1.68 Ma) sediments as observed from the degree of pedogenesis and the type of palaeosols. In general, the Upper Siwalik sub-group in the Ramnagar sub-basin is subdivided from bottom to top into the Purmandal sandstone (4.92-4.49 Ma), Nagrota (4.49-1.68 Ma) and Boulder Conglomerate (&lt;1.68 Ma) formations on the basis of sedimentological characters and change in dominant lithology. Presence of mudstone, a few thin gravel beds and dominant sandstone lithology with weakly to moderately developed palaeosols in the Purmandal sandstone Fm. indicates deposition by shallow braided fluvial streams. The deposition of mudstone dominant Nagrota Fm. with moderately to some well developed palaeosols and a zone of gleyed palaeosols with laminated mudstones and thin sandstones took place in an environment marked by numerous small lakes, water-logged regions and small streams in an environment just south of the Piedmont zone, perhaps similar to what is happening presently in the Upland region/the Upper Gangetic plain. This area is locally called the 'Trai region' (Pascoe, 1964). Deposition of Boulder Conglomerate Fm. took place by gravelly braided river system close to the Himalayan Ranges. Activity along the Main Boundary Fault led to progradation of these environments distal-ward and led to development of on the whole a coarsening upward sequence. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In this work, an integrated study was carried out to delineate the prevailing subsurface fault structures and their tectonic position in the southern part of the Sinai Peninsula. The study area is selected due to its active tectonic situation. This study is implemented using the available geophysical data; these include magnetic, Bouguer gravity, seismic data to trace the delineated fault structures in shallow subsurface and magnetotelluric data to trace down these structures at deeper depths. To achieve this goal, several techniques have been applied in the interpretation of the data including least squares, trend analysis, Euler deconvolution, 3-D modeling and analytical signal techniques. The results indicate that the main fault structural trends are N 35A degrees-45A degrees W, N 15A degrees-25A degrees E and E-W directions, in accordance with the regional tectonics of the Gulf of Suez rift and Gulf of Aqaba, transform as well as the Tethyan tectonics. The depths to the basement rocks are widely varying from 0 km to about 4 kms. Two seismic lines (EG 31 and MP-70), compiled by Egyptian General Petroleum Cooperation, have been interpreted as well as a geologic cross section derived from well-logging data. The results illustrate that the study area has been affected by the fault structures prevailing there and affecting the rock units and dividing them into several major blocks. The results obtained from 2-D inversions of magnetotelluric soundings show that the fault structures that have E-W trends extend to deeper depths than faults which have N35A degrees-45A degrees W, N15A degrees-25A degrees E.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Donggou Mo deposit in the eastern Qinling area, China, is a giant porphyry system discovered based on a targeting concept by using the tectonic model for collisional orogeny, metallogeny and fluid flow (CMF model). Mo mineralization is associated with the Donggou aluminous A-type granite porphyry and was formed during the Early Cretaceous in a tectonic regime of continental extension. The orebodies mainly occur as numerous veinlets in the host-rocks. Hydrothermal ore-forming processes include at least three stages, characterized by veinlets of (1) quartz + K-feldspar + minor molybdenite, (2) quartz + molybdenite +/- beryl and (3) quartz + carbonate + fluorite.
   <br>Three types of fluid inclusions (FIs) are distinguished in quartz and beryl in stages 1 and 2, i.e., aqueous (W-type), carbonic-aqueous (C-type) and solid-bearing (S-type), with only aqueous FIs observed in stage 3 minerals. S-type FIs contain variable daughter minerals including halite, chalcopyrite, calcite and an unidentified transparent crystal, but only halite can dissolve during heating. Halite-bearing S-type FIs are mainly homogenized by halite dissolution at 182-416 degrees C, corresponding to salinities of 30.9-49.2 wt.% NaCl equiv.; minor halite-bearing S-type FIs are homogenized to liquid at 190-360 degrees C via vapor disappearance, with salinities of 29.1-36.2 wt.% NaCl equiv. Other FIs in minerals of stages 1, 2 and 3 are homogenized at temperatures of 341-550 degrees C, 220-440 degrees C and 125-225 degrees C, with salinities of 8.0-18.3, 5.3-16.8 and 0.5-7.3 wt.% NaCl equiv., respectively. The estimated minimum trapping pressures are up to 141 MPa in stage 1 and up to 81 MPa in stage 2, respectively, corresponding to an initial mineralization depth of no less than 5 km. The quartz in veinlets yields delta O-18 values of 85-10.0%0, corresponding to delta(OH2O)-O-18 values of -2.9 to 5.9%., while the delta D-H2O values of fluid inclusions range from -59 to -82%.. These data suggest that the ore fluids forming the Donggou deposit changed from high-temperature, high-salinity, CO2-rich magmatic to low-temperature, low-salinity and CO2-poor meteoritic fluids via boiling and mixing, resembling those of other magmatic-hydrothermal systems in Qinling Orogen and Dabie Shan. This supports the notion that the porphyry systems generated in a post-collisional tectonic setting were initially CO2-rich, as indicated by abundant C-type and CO2-bearing S-type fluid inclusions.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Chimalpahad Anorthosite Complex, which contains layers of chromitites, is located within the Archean Peninsular Gneissic Complex in the SE Indian shield. Here we present Re-Os isotope systematics of the chromitites and associated websterites and anorthosites in tracing the petrogenetic history and heterogeneity of the source mantle. The average initial Os-187/Os-188 compositions of chromitites are 0.1045 with negative gamma Os values of -17.67, whereas the websterites and anorthosites have average initial Os-187/Os-188 compositions of 14.86 and 11.79 with positive gamma Os values of +467 and + 215, respectively. Mantle extraction ages (T-MA) of the chromites indicate depletion of primitive mantle beginning as early as similar to 3.5 Ga. The subchondritic signature of Os in the chromitite is comparable with those of the chromites from ultramafic intrusions in the Zimbabwe Craton interpreted to reflect sequential extraction from evolving Archean subcontinental lithospheric mantle. The younger (T-MA) ages of 2.77-1.41 Ga of the websterites and anorthosites indicate Proterozoic melt depletion or complex isotopic systematics resulting from overprinting of tectonic events. The geochemical data and Re-Os isotope systematics presented in this study suggest that the Chimalpahad Complex formed from protracted evolution of ultramafic-mafic magmas in a deep-seated chamber of a magmatic arc along the SE margin of the Indian plate.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Guilaizhuang deposit is the largest gold producer in the southwestern Shandong Province with a unique Au-Te mineralization feature different from the other gold deposits in the adjacent Jiaodong Peninsula. The Tongshi alkaline intrusive complex, which is composed of syenites and monzonites with a crystallization age of similar to 180 Ma, is the main magmatic unit in this area, and considered to represent post-collisional magmatism. The syenite intruded into the sedimentary carbonate sequence in the Guilaizhuang district, cryptoexploded and was altered by fluorine-rich fluid. The intensely mineralized cryptoexplosive breccias along the EW-trending fault are extensively cemented by fluorite and calcite minerals. The intrusive age of the syenite should mark the lower limit of the gold mineralization age, whereas the formation age of the fluorite and calcite would represent the upper limit. In this study, we analyzed zircons from the altered syenite in the open-pit, and the results show U-Pb ages of 179-180 Ma consistent with those of the Tongshi intrusive complex. We also present a Sm-Nd isochron age from the fluorite-calcite mineral pair that shows 181 Ma. Based on those results, we infer the timing of gold mineralization to be approximately 180 Ma, coeval with the intrusion of the Tongshi complex. A correlation with the regional tectonic milieu shows that the Guilaizhuang gold deposit was located in a post-collision setting at this time, following the amalgamation between the North China Craton and the Yangtze Craton. Thus, the Guilaizhuang deposit should mark an important alkaline rock-related gold-forming event within the eastern margin of the North China Craton in a post-collisional setting associated with the collision of the North China Craton and Yangtze Craton during late Triassic to Early Jurassic, and is obviously different from the Early Cretaceous intensive gold mineralization in the adjacent Jiaodong Peninsula.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The planned InSight mission will deliver a single seismic station containing 3-component broadband and short-period sensors to the surface of Mars in 2016. While much of the progress in understanding the Earth and Moon's interior has relied on the use of seismic networks for accurate location of sources, single station approaches can be applied to data returned from Mars in order to locate events and determine interior structure. In preparation for the data return from Insight, we use a terrestrial dataset recorded at the Global Seismic Network station BFO, located at the Black Forest Observatory in Germany, to verify an approach for event location and structure determination based on recordings of multiple orbit surface waves, which will be more favorable to record on Mars than Earth due to smaller planetary radius and potentially lower background noise. With this approach applied to events near the threshold of observability on Earth, we are able to determine epicentral distance within approximately 1 degrees (corresponding to similar to 60 km on Mars), and origin time within similar to 30 s. With back azimuth determined from Rayleigh wave polarization, absolute locations are determined generally within an aperture of 10 degrees, allowing for localization within large tectonic regions on Mars. With these locations, we are able to recover Earth mantle structure within +/- 5% (the InSight mission requirements for martian mantle structure) using ID travel time inversions of P and S travel times for datasets of only 7 events. The location algorithm also allows for the measurement of great-circle averaged group velocity dispersion, which we measure between 40 and 200 s to scale the expected reliable frequency range of the InSight data from Earth to Mars data. Using the terrestrial data, we are able to resolve structure down to similar to 200 km, but synthetic tests demonstrate we should be able to resolve martian structure to similar to 400 km with the same frequency content given the smaller planetary size.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The large, newly discovered Sharang porphyry Mo deposit and nearby Yaguila skarn Pb-Zn-Ag (-Mo) deposit reside in the central Lhasa terrane, northern Gangdese metallogenic belt, Tibet. Multiple mineral chronometers (zircon U-Pb, sericite Ar-40-Ar-39, and zircon and apatite (U-Th)/He) reveal that ore-forming porphyritic intrusions experienced rapid cooling (&gt;100 degrees C/Ma) during a monotonic magmatic-hydrothermal evolution. The magmatic-hydrothermal ore-forming event at Sharang lasted similar to 6.0 Myr (similar to 1.8 Myr for cooling from &gt;900 to 350 degrees C and similar to 4.0 Myr for cooling from 350 to 200 degrees C) whereas cooling was more prolonged during ore formation at Yaguila (similar to 1.8 Myr from &gt;900 to 500 degrees C and a maximum of similar to 16 Myr from &gt;900 to 350 degrees C). All porphyritic intrusions in the ore district experienced exhumation at a rate of 0.07-0.09 mm/yr (apatite He ages between similar to 37 and 30 Ma). Combined with previous studies, this work implies that uplift of the eastern section of the Lhasa terrane expanded from central Lhasa (37-30 Ma) to southern Lhasa (15-12 Ma) at an increasing exhumation rate. All available geochronologic data reveal that magmatic-hydrothermal-exhumation activities in the Sharang-Yaguila ore district occurred within four periods of magmatism with related mineralization. Significant porphyry-type Mo mineralization was associated with Late Cretaceous-Eocene felsic porphyritic intrusions in the central Lhasa terrane, resulting from Neotethyan oceanic subduction and India-Asia continental collision.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Numerous wolframite-quartz vein type tungsten deposits are present in the Gannan metallogenic belt, South China, including the Piaotang and Dangping deposits in the Chong-You-Yu ore cluster, the Dajishan deposit in the Jiulianshan ore cluster, and the Pangushan deposit in the Yushan ore cluster. The ores generally consist of quartz and wolframite, with variable amounts of base metal sulfides. Wolframite and quartz are intergrown, but the genetic relationships between them are still ambiguous. Quartz contains two-phase aqueous inclusions (type 1) and two- or three-phase CO2-bearing inclusions (type II), but wolframite only contains two-phase aqueous inclusions (type 1w). The homogenization temperatures for primary inclusions in wolframite are generally 40 to 100 degrees C higher than those in quartz in a single deposit. Moreover, there are variable amounts of CO2 in inclusions in quartz, but no CO2-rich inclusions are identified in coexisting wolframite. Type I fluid inclusions in quartz from the Piaotang deposit show that fluid mixing is predominant in the formation of quartz veins, whereas fluid inclusions from the Dangping deposit suggest that simple cooling is the primary factor. Quartz from the Dajishan and Pangushan deposits contains both type I and coexisting type II inclusions, indicating a process of fluid immiscibility. The homogenization temperatures of two-phase aqueous inclusions (type Iw) in wolframite from all of these deposits show a clearly decreasing trend with constant salinities, implying a simple cooling process. Hence, simple cooling, fluid mixing, and fluid immiscibility take place in quartz but only simple cooling happens in wolframite. Our results show that the gangue and ore minerals from the Late Mesozoic tungsten deposits in the Gannan metallogenic belt have different homogenization temperatures, volatile compositions, and fluid processes. The gangue minerals do not provide reasonable estimates of the depositional conditions of the ore minerals even though they are intimately intergrown. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The gravity anomaly field over the whole Earth obtained by the GOCE satellite is a revolutionary tool to reveal geologic information on a continental scale for the large areas where conventional gravity measurements have yet to be made. It is, however, necessary to isolate the near-surface geologic signal from the contributions of thickness variations in the crust and lithosphere and the isostatic compensation of surface relief. Here Africa is studied with particular emphasis on selected geological features which are expected to appear as density inhomogeneities. These include cratons and fold belts in the Precambrian basement, the overlying sedimentary basins and magmatism, as well as the continental margins. Regression analysis between gravity and topography shows coefficients that are consistently positive for the free air gravity anomaly and negative for the Bouguer gravity anomaly. The error and scatter on the regression are smallest in oceanic areas, where it is a possible tool for identifying changes in crustal type. The regression analysis allows the large gradient in the Bouguer anomaly signal across continental margins to be removed. After subtracting the predicted effect of known topography from the original Bouguer anomaly field, the residual field shows a continent-wide pattern of anomalies that could be attributed to regional geological structures. A few of these are highlighted, such as those representing Karoo magmatism, the Kibalian foldbelt, the Zimbabwe Craton, the Cameroon and Tibesti volcanic deposits, the Benue Trough and the Luangwa Rift. A reconstruction of the pre-break up position of Africa and South America (the plates forming West Gondwana) is made for the residual GOCE gravity field. The reconstruction allows the positive and negative anomalies to be compared across the continental fragments, and so helps identify common geologic units that extend across both the now-separate continents.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Khopik porphyry copper (Au, Mo) prospect in Eastern Iran is associated with a succession of Middle to Late Eocene I-type, high-K, calc-alkaline to shoshonite, monzonitic to dioritic subvolcanic porphyry stocks emplaced within cogenetic volcanic rocks. Laser-ablation U-Pb zircon ages indicate that the monzonite stocks crystallized over a short time span during the Middle Eocene (39.0 +/- 0.8 Ma to 38.2 +/- 0.8 Ma) as result of subduction of the Afghan block beneath the Lut block.
   <br>Porphyry copper mineralization is hosted by the monzonitic intrusions and is associated with a hydrothermal alteration that includes potassic, sericitic-potassic, quartz-sericite-carbonate-pyrite (QSCP), quartz-carbonate-pyrite (QCP), and propylitic zones. Mineralization occurs as disseminated to stockwork styles, and as minor hydrothermal breccias. Some mineralization occurs in fault zones as quartz-sulfide veins telescoped onto the porphyry system. The main ore minerals are chalcopyrite and bornite with minorpyrite and magnetite and the highest Cu (0.01-0.9 wt. %), Au (&gt;2 ppm), and Mo (&lt;80 ppm) grades are closely associated with potassic alteration zones.
   <br>Unidirectional, pre-ore stage solidification texture (UST) represented by comb-quartz layers within the potassic alteration zone formed from a hypersaline brine (57-73 wt. % NaCl equiv.), low density vapor-rich fluids (4-22 wt. % NaCl equiv.) at temperatures of 482 degrees C to over 600 degrees C. The isotopic composition of oxygen (delta O-18(water) = 8.7-8.9 parts per thousand) suggests that the quartz layers crystallized from magmatic-hydrothermal fluids that exsolved in the upper part of the monzonitic intrusions. Potassic alteration formed from high salinity fluids (51-73 wt. %) at temperatures between 432-592 degrees C, and low salinity vapor-rich solutions with 11-19 wt. % NaCl equiv. Later veinlets in the QSCP zone formed from lower salinity fluids (&lt;47 wt. % NaCl equiv.) at temperatures between 332 degrees-400 degrees C. The oxygen isotopic data for the early alteration zones (delta O-18(water) = 9-93 parts per thousand for potassic and 7.3 parts per thousand for QSCP) also indicate a magmatic origin for the ore fluids.
   <br>The widespread presence of Middle Eocene to Lower Oligocene magmatism and mineralization in Eastern Iran suggests the presence of another important porphyry copper belt in addition to the northwest-southeast Urumieh-Dokhtar copper belt of Iran.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Permo-Triassic continental large igneous provinces (Lips) of Eurasia linked in to orogenic systems in decay. Their bulk appearance varies from the massive flood-basalts and (ultra)mafic intrusives to the groups of coeval, widely spread, diverse intrusions and extrusions of the Scattered Igneous Provinces (SIPs). In the interval from the demise of the orogens to the inception of the LIPs and SIPs, diverse ore deposits were formed which, depending on the predominant expression of the hosting system, have been interpreted as orogen-related and LIP- or SIP-related. In the case of the voluminous (ultra)mafic complexes, a mantle origin is indicated. This leads to the concept of active mantle plumes issuing from the core-mantle boundary in view of the exceptional volumes and the high temperature inferred to melt the source complexes. However, the substantial volumes of fluids that entered the sub-continental mantle on prior subduction of oceanic lithosphere lowered the solidus temperature and modified the composition of the sub-continental mantle. As a consequence, the conditional high temperature is superfluous. In this context, the setting of the Jiaodong Province and the evolution of the hosting North China Craton suggest that:
   <br>1 the introduction of fluids during prolonged subduction of oceanic lithosphere can also modify the rheology of the deep lithosphere; this reinforces the role of plate tectonic processes in the generation and the in-and extrusion of voluminous, mantle-derived melts;
   <br>2 the prolific gold deposits could form because of the stalled, subducted Pacific lithosphere slab with its oxidizing potential and its position within the mantle transition zone; as elsewhere, continent-scale, translithospheric strike-slip deformation played an indispensable role in decompression and in the migration of melts, fluids, volatiles and metals;
   <br>3 orogenic gold deposits can form independent of orogenesis; should, after all, a relevant orogen be delineated in the coastal belt of eastern Asia, the question arises concerning the dependence of orogenic gold deposits on the nature of an orogen.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>More recent explorations (from 2009 to 2013) indicate a minimum of 27 tonnes Au of additional resources in the Guocheng-Liaoshang gold belt, northeastern Jiaolai basin, Jiaodong gold province. The ores are hosted in faults/fractures in Paleoproterozoic metamorphic and granitic rocks, and are marked by massive sulfide type with sulfides of up to 40 to 95 vol.%. Rb-Sr isotopic dating of mineralized quartz yielded an isochron age of 116.2 +/- 2.4 Ma (MSWD = 0.36). The ore-related quartz samples have delta D values of -86 to -69 parts per thousand (mean -78 parts per thousand), with calculated delta O-18(H2O) values of 0.6 to 7.7 parts per thousand (average 3.6%0). The delta S-34 values of ore sulfides vary from 8.5 to 12.7 parts per thousand with an average of 9.9 parts per thousand. Lead isotope signatures recorded in sulfides are much less radiogenic (Pb-206/(204)pb = 17.039-17.862) relative to that of Phanerozoic convecting mantle ((206)pb/(204)pb = 18.179-18.384). These results show that the gold mineralization style in this belt is different from the traditionally identified three types of gold deposits in the Jiaodong Peninsula (namely, Linglong, Jiaojia and Pengjiakuang type). They also suggest deep-seated, most likely mafic dike magmatic and mantle-derived, sources for the ore fluids, sulfur and metals in the hydrothermal system, despite the fact that wall rocks might provide some sulfur to satisfy the enriched S-34 signature. The inferred mantle reservoir was probably formed by subduction-related fluid metaso-matism during the Paleoproterozoic (ca. 1.85 Ga) Jiao-Liao-Ji mobile belt assembly (suture within Columbia supercontinent). Extensional tectonic inversion during early Cretaceous, caused by subduction of the Kula-Pacific plate rather than postcollisional process of the Qinling-Dabie-Sulu Orogen, triggered partial melting of this mantle domain, subsequent magma mixing and final exsolution of ore-forming fluids.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>More than 200 iron deposits with about 4 billion tons of iron ore have been discovered in Iran. Major iron oxide districts comprise the Bafq-Posht-e-Badam back arc district in Central Iranian microcontinent, the Ac Kahoor and Hormoz districts in the Zagros mountain range, the Gol-e-Gohar and Hamekasi deposits in the Sanandaj-Sirjan magmatic-metamorphic zone and also the Sangan deposit east of Central Iran. Several smaller iron ore deposits are distributed in the Alborz-Azarbaijan magmatic belt. There is a significant correspondence between the distribution of these deposits and main suture zones in the Iran plate composite. Stratiform iron deposits with a volcano-sedimentary origin are common features of the rifting phases of the future Prototethys and Neotethys oceans. Kiruna-type iron oxide deposits of the Zanjan area, and Fe skarn and iron oxide-copper-gold deposits in the Khaf-Bardaskan-Kashmar district are associated with subduction of Neotethys Ocean. Kiruna-type deposits within the Kashmar-Kerman magmatic arc are related to the Prototethys. Different geotectonic scenarios and their evolution explain the distribution patterns of most of the Fe and Fe-Mn deposits in Iran. Stratiform volcano-sedimentary Fe- and Fe-Mn deposits are related to the rift basin, and other types of Fe and Fe-Mn deposits such as the Kiruna-type deposits, skarn and iron oxide-copper-gold deposits in Iran are related to basin closure and plate collision. Magmatism in the subduction zone produced the magmatic and hydrothermal fluids, which caused Fe and Fe-Mn mineralisation in Central Iran microcontinent, Sanandaj-Sirjan magmatic-metamorphic zone, Alborz-Azarbaijan magmatic belt, east of Central Iran and the Lut blocks.
   <br>The Central Iran microcontinent (Khaf-Bardaskan-Kashmar district), east of Central Iran, the Sanandaj-Sirjan zone and the Alborz-Azarbaijan belts are the most prospective districts for Fe and Fe-Mn exploration. Based on the age data on the studied deposits, favourable time periods for the largest Fe and Fe-Mn mineralising events in Iran were the Neoproterozoic-lower Cambrian (volcano-sedimentary and Kiruna-type deposits), upper Paleozoic-lower Mesozoic (volcano-sedimentary iron deposits) and Cenozoic (Kiruna type, iron oxide-copper-gold deposits and especially skarn deposits).</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Subduction of Neo-Tethyan oceanic crust and the subsequent continental collision has created important geological features along the Alpine-Himalayan orogenic belt, including various magmatic arcs and related mineralizations. In Iran, the Tertiary Urumieh-Dokhtar magmatic arc (UDMA) is formed in this way and hosts most of the porphyry copper deposits (PCDs) and prospects in Iran. The northernmost intrusion along the UDMA is the Qaradagh batholith, which lies in the Ahar-Jolfa metallogenic zone, and contains vein- and stockwork-type Cu-Mo-Au mineralization, while its northern extension in the South Armenian Block (SAB), known as the Meghri-Ordubad pluton, also hosts several large porphyry Cu-Mo deposits. Mineralization in the Qaradagh batholith has occurred within Eocene-Oligocene granitoid rocks, among which the granodioritic component is the dominant rock type.
   <br>The Re-Os model ages calculated for molybdenite samples from the Qarachilar area in the central part of the Qaradagh batholith range between 25.19 +/- 0.19Ma and 31.22 +/- 0.28Ma, referring to middle-late Oligocene. On a regional scale, the studied mineralization is contemporaneous with the third metallogenic epoch in the Lesser Caucasus, definitely with the Kadjaran and Paragachai PCDs in the SAB. However, it is younger than most of the other events across the Meghri-Ordubad pluton, which occurred during the Eocene. Integration of the data obtained in this study with the other age reports across the Meghri-Ordubad pluton may reflect the protracted and episodic nature of magmatism-mineralization in the whole region. Meanwhile, the obtained ages are older than the few age reports from central Iran (Miduk, Sarkuh, and Iju PCDs), which show middle-late Miocene ages. This age difference may reflect the dischronous and later-stage closure of the Neo-Tethys Ocean in central parts of Iran compared with its northwestern section.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The northern Yangtze foreland basin system was formed during the Mesozoic continental collision between the North and South China plates along the Mianlue suture. In response to the later phase of intra-continental thrust deformation, an extensive E-W-trending molasse basin with river, deltaic, and lake deposits was produced in front of the southern Qinling-Dabieshan foreland fold-and-thrust belt during the Early-Middle Jurassic (201-163Ma). The basin originated during the Early Jurassic (201-174Ma) and substantially subsided during the Middle Jurassic (174-163Ma). A gravelly alluvial fan depositional system developed in the lower part of the Baitianba Formation (Lower Jurassic) and progressively evolved into a meandering river fluvial plain and lake systems to the south. The alluvial fan conglomerates responded to the initial uplift of the southern Qinling-Dabieshan foreland fold-and-thrust belt after the oblique collision between the Yangtze and North China plates during the Late Triassic. The Qianfoya Formation (lower Middle Jurassic) mainly developed from shore-shallow lacustrine depositional systems. The Shaximiao Formation (upper Middle Jurassic) predominantly consists of thick-bedded braided river delta successions that serve as the main body of the basin-filling sequences. The upward-coarsening succession of the Shaximiao Formation was controlled by intense thrusting in the southern Qinling-Dabieshan fold-and-thrust belt. Palaeogeographic reconstructions indicated an extensive E-W foredeep depozone along the fold-and-thrust belt during the Middle Jurassic (174-163Ma) that was nearly 150km wide. The depozone extended westward to the Longmenshan and further east to the northern middle Yangtze plate. The northern Yangtze foreland basin was almost completely buried or modified by the subsequent differential thrusting of Dabashan and its eastern regions (Late Jurassic to Cenozoic).</td>

One transect across the Zhaga Formation was investigated. The Zhaga Formation is ~2km thick, dominated by greywacke and conglomerate at the base, basalt and limestone in the middle, and greywacke and shale at the top. Greywacke in the Zhaga Formation typically contains 70-75% quartz, 5% feldspar, 3-5% rock debris, and &gt;15% matrix, with normal grading and convolute bedding, basal flow structures, and distinct Bouma sequences interpreted as bathyal to abyssal turbidites. One rhyolite sample and one greywacke sample from the studied transect were collected for zircon U-Pb dating. The rhyolite yields a concordia age of 118Ma, and the greywacke yields nine age peaks of 247, 330, 459, 541, 611, 941, 1590, 1871, and 2482Ma, indicating that the Zhaga Formation formed during the late Early Cretaceous and the provenance of its detritus was the Qiangtang area. These data, combined with the Early Cretaceous ocean islands, indicates that the Bangong-Nujiang Neo-Tethys Ocean must have been open during the late Early Cretaceous. We conclude that the Bangong-Nujiang Neo-Tethys Ocean closed after the late Early Cretaceous and not during the Late Jurassic or the early Early Cretaceous as proposed by previous workers.</td>

In the Arctic offshore west Svalbard, for instance, seepage at 200-400m water depth may be explained by ocean temperature-controlled gas hydrate instabilities at the shelf break, but additional processes are required to explain seepage in permanently cold waters at depths &gt;1000m. We discuss the influence of tectonic stress on seepage evolution along the similar to 100km long hydrate-bearing Vestnesa Ridge in Fram Strait. High-resolution P-Cable 3-D seismic data revealed fine-scale (&gt;10m width) near-vertical faults and fractures controlling seepage distribution. Gas chimneys record multiple seepage events coinciding with glacial intensification and active faulting. The faults document the influence of nearby tectonic stress fields in seepage evolution along this deepwater gas hydrate system for at least the last similar to 2.7Ma.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Red palaeosol, as an important archive of ancient pedoenvironments, effectively reflects the palaeoenvironmental change and tectonic uplift history of the plateau. Four red palaeosol profiles were collected at 2200 to 2400 m elevations from the Yunnan Plateau (YP) to investigate the pedogenic' features, chemical weathering process and mineral assemblages of soils. Pedological, geochemical and mineralogical techniques were used to understand the palaeopedogenic, palaeoenvironmental change and landscape evolution of the Plateau. Pedologically, the red palaeosols were characterized by the dark red color (a hue of 5YR or redder), strong acidity (pH &lt; 5.4), and high free iron oxide (&gt;50 g kg(-1)) and clay (&gt;50%) contents. The red palaeosols were enriched with Fe2O3, Al2O3, and TiO2 with very low contents of CaO, MgO, Na2O, and K2O and slightly low contents of Si2O and MnO. Chemical weathering indices, such as CIA (CIA = [1Al(2)O(3) / (Al2O3 + CaO + Na2O + K2O)] x 100), Sa (Sa = SiO2 / Al2O3), Saf (Saf = SiO2 / Al2O3 + Fe2O3), and A-CN-K diagram (Al2O3-CaO + Na2O-K2O), indicated that the red palaeosols had experienced strong chemical weathering processes. Scanning electron microscopy analyses revealed that quartz grains of the red palaeosols were characterized by a number of deep dissolution pits and cracks on their surfaces. The clay minerals of the red palaeosols were composed of kaolinite, gibbsite, hematite, and vermiculite in the order of abundance. Pedogenical, geochemical and clay mineralogical evidences revealed that the red palaeosols were developed by palaeopedogenic processes under tropical climatic environments. The presence of highly weathered soils at an altitude of 2200-2400 m indicated the influence of tectonic uplift on the soil vertical distribution. It is estimated that the red palaeosols had uplifted about 1600-2000 m since their initial formation. Palaeopedogenesis of red palaeosols provides new insight into the palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental reconstruct and tectonic movement of YP. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The high pressure metamorphic zone of As Sifah area in the Saih Hatat window, NE Oman plays a vital role to study global tectonic setting, metamorphism, transport direction and age of initial ophiolite emplacement. Scientists and researchers are keen in determining the protolith, structural evolution, and timing and metamorphic conditions of the Saih Hatat area. In this study, mapping of the metamorphic zone and discrimination of associated rock formations occurred in the As Sifah region is carried out using visible and near infrared-shortwave infrared (VNIR-SWIR) spectral bands of Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and well known image processing methods such as image decorrelation, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Spectral Angel Mapper (SAM). The study delineated the region of metamorphic zone and discriminated the different metamorphic and carbonate rocks of the study area characterized by hydroxyl (OH) and carbonate bearing minerals. The assessment of accuracy for the occurrence and spatial distribution of major lithological units provided the overall accuracy of 96.06% with Kappa Coefficient = 0.95 in the matrix of Maximum Likelihood (ML) and compared with the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) and Spectral Information Divergence (SID) algorithms. The occurrence of such minerals are detected and confirmed by SAM supervised classification method. The study also describes the spectral character of metamorphic and carbonates minerals. The metamorphic zone and associated rock types interpreted over the images are verified in the field and checked for their occurrences and spatial distributions. The occurrence of CO3 bearing carbonate minerals and OH bearing metamorphic minerals are confirmed further under microscope, XRD analysis and PIMA spectral measurements in the laboratory studies. The study proved sensor capability of ASTER to discriminate metamorphic rocks from associated formations and detection of different mineral occurrences. It is recommended to use the studied technique to map metamorphic zone occurred in the rugged topography, where it is difficult to do conventional geological mapping in similar arid regions.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>New compilations of global O isotope data from zircon and siliciclastic sedimentary rocks highlight an increasing range in 8180 values in both systems since the late Archean. This is consistent with an increased clay component in sedimentary rocks and subsequent incorporation into igneous rocks. Each of these factors can arguably be achieved by increased crustal thickening in the late Archean resulting in greater burial and melting of supracrustal rocks and increased chemical weathering and recycling of upper crustal rocks. Despite the suggested change in tectonic regimes in the late Archean, stochastic modelling in this study demonstrates that 8180 data do not provide evidence for a secular decrease in the proportion of mantle-derived magmas in granitoid rocks. Instead, best-fit models indicate that juvenile input and reworking of supracrustal material vary with respect to the short term (100-200 Myr) tectonic cycles preserved in the continental crust. Hence, major step changes in global tectonic regimes in the post-Hadean, such as the initiation of subduction in the mid- to late Archean, are not supported by global zircon O isotope datasets and instead minor, progressive changes are indicated for Earth's tectonic regimes.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The pattern of eruptions at long-lived volcanic centers provides a window into the co-evolution of crustal magma transport, tectonic stresses, and unsteady magma generation at depth. Mount Mazama in the Oregon Cascades has seen variable activity over the last 400 ky, including the 50 km(3) climactic eruption at ca. 7.7 ka that produced Crater Lake caldera. The physical mechanisms responsible for the assembly of silicic magma reservoirs that are the precursors to caldera-forming eruptions are poorly understood. Here we argue that the spatial and temporal distribution of geographically clustered volcanic vents near Mazama reflects the development of a centralized magma chamber that fed the climactic eruption. Time-averaged eruption rates at Mount Mazama imply an order of magnitude increase in deep magma influx prior to the caldera-forming event, suggesting that unsteady mantle melting triggered a chamber growth episode that culminated in caldera formation. We model magma chamber-dike interactions over similar to 50 ky preceding the climactic eruption to fit the observed distribution of surface eruptive vents in space and time, as well as petrologically estimated deep influx rates. Best fitting models predict an expanding zone of dike capture caused by a growing, oblate spheroidal magma chamber with 10-30 MPa of overpressure. This growing zone of chamber influence causes closest approaching regional mafic vent locations as well as more compositionally evolved Mazama eruptions to migrate away from the climactic eruptive center, returning as observed to the center after the chamber drains during the caldera-forming eruption.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The mechanisms and timing of mountain growth in Scandinavia remain enigmatic given that the region has not been involved in active orogenesis since the Devonian and in any large-scale tectonic activities after the NE Atlantic breakup during the early Cenozoic. In this study we combine analysis of the vertical motions of the region caused by (dominantly) glacial erosion during the Quaternary with Apatite Fission Track (AFT) analysis of rocks from the area. Using numerical models, we first quantify how fluvial and glacial erosion carved out the fjords and valleys to a depth of 2 km below the paleosurfaces. This erosional episode represents a major local weight loss and results in up to a 0.8-km uplift of rocks and up to a 0.5-km rise of local topography. These estimates only marginally depend on the effective elastic thickness of the lithosphere and thus are robust We show then that no correlation exists between sample altitude and published AFT data, but that a correlation does exist between AFT age and the depth below our constructed pre-glacial summit surface. This correlation demonstrates the robustness of the numerical erosional model, quantifies average erosion rates during Carboniferous-Cretaceous at &lt;10 m/My, and outlines the regions of western Scandinavia (Lofoten and Bergen areas and More-Trondelag fault complex) with atypical Mesozoic-Cenozoic evolution, probably related to regional tectonic activities.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Plate tectonics successfully describes the surface of Earth as a mosaic of moving lithospheric plates. But it is not clear what happens at the base of the plates, the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB). The LAB has been well imaged with converted teleseismic waves(1,2), whose 10-40-kilometre wavelength controls the structural resolution. Here we use explosion-generated seismic waves (of about 0.5-kilometre wavelength) to form a high-resolution image for the base of an oceanic plate that is subducting beneath North Island, New Zealand. Our 80-kilometre-wide image is based on P-wave reflections and shows an approximately 15 degrees dipping, abrupt, seismic wave-speed transition (less than 1 kilometre thick) at a depth of about 100 kilometres. The boundary is parallel to the top of the plate and seismic attributes indicate a P-wave speed decrease of at least 8 +/- 3 per cent across it. A parallel reflection event approximately 10 kilometres deeper shows that the decrease in P-wave speed is confined to a channel at the base of the plate, which we interpret as a sheared zone of ponded partial melts or volatiles. This is independent, high-resolution evidence for a low-viscosity channel at the LAB that decouples plates from mantle flow beneath, and allows plate tectonics to work.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Background: The enormous diversity found in East African cichlid fishes in terms of morphology, coloration, and behavior have made them a model for the study of speciation and adaptive evolution. In particular, haplochromine cichlids, by far the most species-rich lineage of cichlids, are a well-known textbook example for parallel evolution. Southwestern Uganda is an area of high tectonic activity, and is home to numerous crater lakes. Many Ugandan crater lakes were colonized, apparently independently, by a single lineage of haplochromine cichlids. Thereby, this system could be considered a natural experiment in which one can study the interaction between geographical isolation and natural selection promoting phenotypic diversification.
   <br>Results: We sampled 13 crater lakes and six potentially-ancestral older lakes and, using both mitochondrial and microsatellite markers, discovered strong genetic and morphological differentiation whereby (a) geographically close lakes tend to be genetically more similar and (b) three different geographic areas seem to have been colonized by three independent waves of colonization from the same source population. Using a geometric morphometric approach, we found that body shape elongation (i.e. a limnetic morphology) evolved repeatedly from the ancestral deeper-bodied benthic morphology in the clear and deep crater lake habitats.
   <br>Conclusions: A pattern of strong genetic and morphological differentiation was observed in the Ugandan crater lakes. Our data suggest that body shape changes have repeatedly evolved into a more limnetic-like form in several Ugandan crater lakes after independent waves of colonization from the same source population. The observed morphological changes in crater lake cichlids are likely to result from a common selective regime.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The similar to 200-m-thick riverlaid Bullhead Alluvium along the lower Colorado River downstream of Grand Canyon records massive early Pliocene sediment aggradation following the integration of the upper and lower Colorado River basins. The distribution and extent of the aggraded sediments record (1) evolving longitudinal profiles of the river valley with implications for changing positions of the river's mouth and delta; (2) a pulse of rapid early drainage-basin erosion and sediment supply; and (3) constraints on regional and local deformation.
   <br>The Bullhead Alluvium is inset into the Hualapai and Bouse Formations along a basal erosional unconformity. Its base defines a longitudinal profile interpreted as the incised end result after the Colorado River integrated through lake basins. Subsequent Bullhead aggradation, at ca. 4.5-3.5 Ma, built up braid plains as wide as 50 km as it raised the Colorado River's grade. We interpret the aggradation to record a spike in sediment supply when river integration and base-level fall destabilized and eroded relict landscapes and Tertiary bedrock in the Colorado River's huge catchment.
   <br>Longitudinal profiles of the Bullhead Alluvium suggest &gt;= 200 m post-Bullhead relative fault uplifts in the upper Lake Mead area, &gt;100 m local subsidence in the Blythe Basin, and deeper subsidence of correlative deltaic sequences in the Salton Trough along the Pacific-North American plate boundary. However, regionally, for &gt;500 km along the river corridor from Yuma, Arizona, to Lake Mead, Arizona and Nevada, the top of the Bullhead Alluvium appears to be neither uplifted nor tilted, sloping 0.5-0.6 m/km downstream like the gradient of a smaller late Pleistocene aggradation sequence. Perched outcrops tentatively assigned to the Bullhead Alluvium near the San Andreas fault system project toward a Pliocene seashore or bayline twice as distant (300-450 km) as either the modern river's mouth or a tectonically restored 4.25 Ma paleoshore. We conclude that Bullhead aggradation peaked after 4.25 Ma, having lengthened the delta plain seaward by outpacing both 2 mm/yr delta subsidence and 43-45 mm/yr transform-fault offset of the delta. Post-Bullhead degradation started before 3.3 Ma and implies that the river profile lowered and shortened because sediment supply declined, and progradation was unable to keep up with subsidence and plate motion in the delta.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In the debate on the causes of uplift and landscape evolution of the Alps, most studies focus on regions that were glaciated at some stage during the last 2 m.y. In these areas, it is difficult to separate glacial-driven versus tectonically driven rates of erosion. Here, we present Be-10-derived erosion rates from unglaciated catchments in the Koralpe range at the eastern end of the Alps. This region features strong geomorphologic evidence for landscape transience with young valleys incised into a smooth relict landscape. Erosion rates average 49 +/- 8 mm/k.y. for catchments located on the relict landscape and 137 +/- 15 mm/k.y. for catchments in the incised landscape. From these data, we estimate the onset of incision at 4 +/- 1 Ma, the surface uplift at 350 +/- 90 m, and a total relative base-level fall of 540 +/- 140 m. Our results are in close agreement with both the magnitude and the age of onset of uplift of the Styrian Basin and the northern Molasse Basin, as well as the incision rate of the Mur River into the Styrian karst. The inferred timing of the onset of uplift around 4 Ma relates to interpreted basin inversion in the Pannonian Basin. Since this uplift event appears to have involved both the Pannonian Basin and the entire eastern end of the Alpine mountain range, we suggest that it may have occurred in response to a deep-seated process in the lithosphere. As such, we argue for tectonic drivers for the post-Miocene uplift in the eastern Alps.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Jamaica is located on a restraining bend on the E-trending, left-lateral plate boundary between the Gonave microplate and Caribbean plate. Deformation in southern Jamaica occurs on two reactivated and simultaneously active fault sets: NNW-striking reverse faults and E-striking strike-slip faults. Movement on NNW-striking reverse faults forms fault-propagation folds that are expressed topographically as the Don Figuerero, Santa Cruz, and Brisco Mountains. The NNW-trending ranges (and faults) of southern Jamaica terminate against the E-W-oriented strike-slip faults. The two dominant E-striking, left-lateral strike-slip faults are the South Coast fault zone in the south and the central Jamaica fault system (Cavaliers fault, Rio Minho-Crawle River fault, and the Siloah fault system) in the central part of the island.
   <br>We propose that the restraining bend is the result of reactivated, interacting fault arrays in southern Jamaica. The two fault systems inherited from Cretaceous and Paleogene deformation are reactivated to accommodate current deformation. The NNW-striking reverse faults accommodate E-W shortening, and the E-striking strike-slip faults accommodate both the plate motion and the differential motion of the fault blocks bounded by the NNW-striking reverse faults. This geometry results in topographic highs and lows along strike of the strike-slip faults, as a result of vertical displacement on the NNW-striking reverse faults.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Plate-tectonic models for the Paleozoic evolution of the Arctic are numerous and diverse. Our detrital zircon provenance study of Upper Paleozoic sandstones from Kotel'ny Island (New Siberian Island archipelago) provides new data on the provenance of clastic sediments and crustal affinity of the New Siberian Islands. Upper Devonian-Lower Carboniferous deposits yield detrital zircon populations that are consistent with the age of magmatic and metamorphic rocks within the Grenvillian-Sveconorwegian, Timanian, and Caledonian orogenic belts, but not with the Siberian craton. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test reveals a strong similarity between detrital zircon populations within Devonian-Permian clastics of the New Siberian Islands, Wrangel Island (and possibly Chukotka), and the Severnaya Zemlya Archipelago. These results suggest that the New Siberian Islands, along with Wrangel Island and the Severnaya Zemlya Archipelago, were located along the northern margin of Laurentia-Baltica in the Late Devonian-Mississippian and possibly made up a single tectonic block. Detrital zircon populations from the Permian clastics record a dramatic shift to a Uralian provenance. The data and results presented here provide vital information to aid Paleozoic tectonic reconstructions of the Arctic region prior to opening of the Mesozoic oceanic basins.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Mountains in the U.S. Basin and Range Province are similar in form, yet they have different histories of deformation and uplift. Unfortunately, chronicling fault slip with techniques like thermochronology and geodetics can still leave sizable, yet potentially important gaps at Pliocene-Quaternary (similar to 10(5)-10(6) yr) time scales. Here, we combine existing geochronology with new geomorphic observations and approaches to investigate the Miocene to Quaternary slip history of active normal faults that are exhuming three footwall ranges in northwestern Nevada: the Pine Forest Range, the Jackson Mountains, and the Santa Rosa Range. We use the National Elevation Dataset (10 m) digital elevation model (DEM) to measure bedrock river profiles and hillslope gradients from these ranges. We observe a prominent suite of channel convexities (knickpoints) that segment the channels into upper reaches with low steepness (mean k(sn) = similar to 182; theta(ref) = 0.51) and lower, fault-proximal reaches with high steepness (mean k(sn) = similar to 361), with a concomitant increase in hillslope angles of similar to 6 degrees-9 degrees. Geologic maps and field-based proxies for rock strength allow us to rule out static causes for the knickpoints and interpret them as transient features triggered by a drop in base level that created similar to 20% of the existing relief (similar to 220 m of similar to 1050 m total). We then constrain the timing of base-level change using paleochannel profile reconstructions, catchment-scale volumetric erosion fluxes, and a stream-power-based knickpoint celerity (migration) model. Low-temperature thermochronology data show that faulting began at ca. 11-12 Ma, yet our results estimate knickpoint initiation began in the last 5 Ma and possibly as recently as 0.1 Ma with reasonable migration rates of 0.5-2 mm/yr. We interpret the collective results to be evidence for enhanced Pliocene-Quaternary fault slip that may be related to tectonic reorganization in the American West, although we cannot rule out climate as a contributing mechanism. We propose that similar studies, which remain remarkably rare across the region, be used to further test how robust this Plio-Quaternary landscape signal may be throughout the Great Basin.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Wadi Qutabah layered mafic intrusion in northwestern Yemen, considered part of a giant (&gt;250 km(2)), Neoproterozoic (similar to 638.5 Ma) intrusion referred to as the Suwar - Wadi Qutabah Complex, has significant potential for economic platinum-group element and Ni-Cu-Co mineralization. A search for platinum-group element mineralization at Wadi Qutabah yielded cores from 14 drillholes along two east and west lines. Stratigraphically, they reveal similar to 500 m of interlayered norites with subordinate gabbros, anorthosites, pyroxenites, and massive sulphide layers showing modal and cryptic layering that can be correlated between individual holes and between the east and west areas. Energy dispersive spectrometry major element analyses on mineral phases show gradual upward changes in plagioclase composition from An52 (lowest level drilled) to An44, and En61 to En57 in orthopyroxene, up to a distinctive, ilmenite-rich unit termed 5a (augite norite). Above 5a, minerals show a dramatic shift to more primitive An57 and En69 compositions. The gradual changes are typical of layered mafic intrusions and reflect progressive crystallization of magma upward. The dramatic changes, such as above 5a, are also common and reflect magma chamber recharge. In addition to the 500 m reported here, mineral exploration data from more-mafic rocks at Suwar suggest 400 m of layered rocks below those at Wadi Qutabah (total 900 m). A regression analysis plot of the cumulus mineral (plagioclase and orthopyroxene) compositional change versus thickness for seven well-known, giant, layered mafic intrusions suggests that the Suwar - Wadi Qutabah Complex is &gt;2 km thick and one of the largest (thickness and area) intrusions on Earth. Comparison of the stratigraphy and mineral compositions at Wadi Qutabah with intrusions bearing PGE deposits suggests prospective areas for mineral exploration to the north and south of the study area. Recent reviews identify many similar-aged, mafic-ultramafic intrusive complexes across the Arabian-Nubian Shield. The large size of the Suwar - Wadi Qutabah Complex, its noritic composition, and subcontinental lithospheric mantle signature are characteristics typical of mafic rocks formed in extension-related, continental rift settings. Thus, the Suwar - Wadi Qutabah Complex may be part of a previously unrecognized large igneous province associated with a late Proterozoic magmatic event and preserved in what is today, the Arabian Shield.</td>

The rocks of these groups are distinct in chemical composition: the low-Ti amphibolites of the first group with increased Al2O3 contents are similar to modern IABs, whereas the highly-Ti amphibolites of the second group correspond to MORBs and OIBs.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Seismic anisotropy beneath the Eastern Lau Spreading Center (ELSC) is investigated using both Rayleigh waves and shear waves, using data from the 2009-2010 ELSC ocean bottom seismograph experiment. Phase velocities of Rayleigh waves determined by ambient noise cross correlation are inverted for azimuthally anisotropic phase velocity maps. Splitting of S waves from five intermediate and deep focus earthquakes was determined by waveform analysis. Taken together, Rayleigh wave and S wave data indicate that significant (similar to 2%) anisotropy extends to at least 300km depth. Both data sets indicate a fast direction aligned within a few degrees of the N10 degrees E striking ELSC and somewhat oblique to the N25 degrees E strike of the neighboring volcanic arc. We therefore describe the fast direction as spreading perpendicular, not convergence perpendicular and interpret it as due to ridge-parallel flow of the asthenosphere. However, the region arcward (east) of the ELSC has the stronger anisotropy, suggesting that the strongest flow gradients may occur in the region between the spreading center and the arc, in contrast to being centered beneath the ELSC. Fluids released from the underlying plate may produce anisotropic hydrous materials, but more importantly lower the viscosity, thus enhancing along-strike flow. Both could contribute to an along-strike fast direction signature. Seafloor spreading diminishes south of the seismic array, ceasing altogether south of latitude 25 degrees S (500km south of the array center), a region dominated by much slower tectonic extension, suggesting that asthenosphere is inflowing from the north to accommodate the increase in asthenospheric volume associated with the seafloor spreading.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Ongoing Himalayan growth is generally thought to be dominated by duplexing and/or extrusion processes. These models may be tested by reconstructing Himalayan fold-thrust belt growth since the middle Miocene. However, our knowledge of basic structural geometry remains too fragmentary to resolve the issue, even in areas with rich stratigraphic diversity such as the northwestern Indian Himalaya. In this region, a primary outstanding question involves the uncertain relationship of the Berinag thrust and the Tons thrust, structures with displacements of &gt;80km and &gt;40km, respectively. The uncertain geometry and kinematics allow for the complete range of duplexing or extrusion processes for the integrated kinematic history since the middle Miocene. To address this issue, field mapping and kinematic analysis were performed to reconstruct the deformation of the Lesser Himalayan Sequence in the northwest Indian Himalaya. Our results reveal a new discovery: a similar to 450m thick top-to-southwest shear zone, termed the Pabbar thrust. The Pabbar thrust placed the Outer Lesser Himalayan Sequence (the Tons thrust hanging wall) directly on the Berinag Group (the Berinag thrust hanging wall). This discovery requires that the Berinag thrust and Tons thrust are, in fact, the same structure, and discrete duplexing processes dominated growth of the northwest Indian Himalaya for the past similar to 10-15million years. Along-strike extension of these kinematics and corresponding geometries is consistent with the observed orogenic framework and resolves a stratigraphic continuity problem across the India-west Nepal border, where prior work suggests that structures are continuous but stratigraphy does not match.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>A detrital zircon U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotopic study was carried out in the Middle Silurian to Late Carboniferous sedimentary strata of the northwestern Tarim Craton in order to understand accretionary processes in the southern part of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt. Detrital zircons from these strata yielded U-Pb ages clustering around 2.8-2.3Ga, 2.0-1.7Ga, 1.3-0.9Ga, 880-600Ma, and 500-400Ma, with age populations and Hf isotopic signatures matching those of magmatic rocks in the Tarim Craton and the Central Tianshan Block. Abundant 500-400Ma detrital zircons most likely reflect deposition in a retroarc foreland basin inboard of an Andean-type magmatic arc to the north, supporting the northern Tarim-Central Tianshan connection during early Paleozoic time. The absence of 380-310Ma zircon population in the Carboniferous siliciclastic rocks suggests that the Central Tianshan Block may have been separated from the Tarim Craton in the Early Devonian, caused by the interarc/back-arc opening of the South Tianshan Ocean. We propose an accretionary orogenic model switching from advancing to retreating mode during Paleozoic time in the southwestern part of the Paleo-Asian Ocean. This transition most likely occurred coevally with the rifting of Southeast Asian blocks from the northeastern margin of Gondwana.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Dinarides-Hellenides result from underthrusting of the Adriatic margin during Africa-Europe convergence. In Albania, they consist of (1) a western zone of nappes derived from Adria; (2) a central belt made up of the Mirdita ophiolites; and (3) an eastern zone, the Korabi-Pelagonia zone, of Variscan basement overlain by Permian to Mesozoic rift deposits and carbonates. Some authors interpret the Korabi-Pelagonia zone as a microcontinent between the Mirdita-Pindos oceanic basin to the west and the eastern Vardar oceanic basin to the east; other regard the Korabi-Pelagonia zone as a tectonic window below a single ophiolitic nappe. This contribution argues for a far-traveled thrust sheet. The Mirdita ophiolites are 165-160Ma. The metamorphic sole yielded Ar-40/Ar-39 ages of 171 to 162Ma. The Korabi-Pelagonia zone is subdivided into the Korabi and Gjegjan subzones. The structural analysis of these rocks supports the rooting of the Mirdita ophiolites in the Western Vardar zone. The post-Variscan cover sequence of the Korabi subzone records two phases of deformation: D-1 is associated with a SE dipping to flat-lying schistosity axial planar to NW verging folds and thrust faults, related to ophiolite obduction; D-2 is a postobduction NNE trending crenulation cleavage. Published zircon fission track analyses yielded 150-125Ma, suggesting that regional metamorphism is Early Cretaceous or older. K-Ar mica ages from correlative rocks of Macedonia cluster between 148 and 130Ma, indicating that D-1 is Late Jurassic. A west directed obduction is favored, as is a rooting east of the Mirdita ophiolites because of the top-to-the-west structural polarity of obduction-related deformation.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Circum-Balkhash-West Junggar metallogenic province, located in the core area of the Central Asian metallogenic domain, is characterized by intense tectonic and magmatic activity, abundant mineral resources and several metallogenic belts in Paleozoic. Main ore deposits include porphyry type Cu, porphyry-quartz vein-greisen type Mo-W, skarn type Cu polymetallic, volcanic massive sulfide (VMS) type polymetallic, epithermal hydrothermal Au, quartz vein-altered rock type medium temperature hydrothermal Au, magma liquation type Cu-Ni sulfide, granite-related Be-U, and podiform chromite deposits. These deposits occurred in a limited area, forming several metallogenic belts. They are Zharma-Saur, Bozshakol-Chingiz and North Balkhash belts in the Balkhash region, Kazakhstan and Saur, Xiemisitai-Sharburti and Barluke-Kalamay belts in the West Junggar region, China. Whether these belts containing the large or world-class ore deposits in Kazakhstan can be extended into China? Whether these giant metal deposits in Kazakhstan were found in the ore belts in China? All significant geological and exploration problems are paid much more attention. Based on previous studies and our present works, according to the metallogenic tectonic setting, deposit types, mineralization characteristics and ages, the mineral systems on this province are divided into nine types at least: (1) Ordovician-Silurian island arc porphyry Cu-Au system; (2) Ordovician island arc volcanic massive sulfide (VMS) Au polymetallic system; (3) Devonian island arc magma liquation Cu-Ni sulfide system; (4) Devonian ophiolite-related Podiform chromite system; (5) Early Carboniferous island arc porphyry or porphyry-epithermal hydrothermal Cu-Au system; (6) Carboniferous island arc porphyry-skarn Cu-Mo-Au system; (7) Late Carboniferous back-arc basin granite-related Be-U system; (8) Early Permian island arc or transition arc between island arc and continental arc porphyry-quartz vein-greisen Mo-W system; (9) Early Permian. island arc quartz vein-altered rock medium temperature hydrothermal Au system. Comparison these systems in these belts, three belts in China have the same mineral system as these belts in Kazakhstan, respectively. Three belts in Kazakhstan firmly enter into China. They are the Zharma-Saur, Bozshakol-Chingiz-Xiemisitai and North Balkhash-Kalamay metallogenic belts which occur both in the West Junggar region, China and in adjacent Balkhash region, Kazakhstan. Thus, the West Junggar region has a perfect mineralization system and precondition and is hopefully to discover the giant deposits.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Balkhash Metallogenic Belt (Kazakhstan) in the Central Asia, with the occurrence of many well-known large and super-large porphyritic Cu-Mo deposits, large skarn Cu deposits, and large rare metal deposits, is one of the multi-core areas of the Central Asian metallogenic domain controlled by boundary strike-slip fault system. Zircon SHRIMP U-Pb, Ar-Ar thermochronology, and apatite fission track dating and thermal history modeling, provide a multidisciplinary approach to constrain the whole course thermohistory of the latest Late Paleozoic intrusive granitic magmatism in the western part of the Balkhash Metallogenic Belt. Zircon SHRIMP U-Pb dating of grantic pluton north to the Borly Cu deposit, reveals intrusive granitic magmatism at 289.7 +/- 2.3 Ma in the Early Permian, which was previously considered as of an age in the Triassic. The latest Late Paleozoic granitic pluton has a similar age with the W-Mo metallogenesis at similar to 289 Ma for the Akshatau deposit. Based on geochronological results from previous and this study, we reconstruct the whole course thermal history, from intrusion, through regional cooling, to the Late Mesozoic exhumation at 92.4 +/- 5.9 Ma, for the granitic pluton.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Kalaxianger porphyry Cu ore belt in northern Xinjiang is situated on the northeastern margin of the Junggar Block, which tectonically formed in the middle part of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt. Most of the deposits in the copper ore belt underwent tectonic deformation, especially the Yuleken porphyry Cu-Mo deposit. The ore-bearing intrusive rocks in the deposit are composed of granite porphyry, granodiorite porphyry and monzogranite porphyry, which intrude into intermediate-mafic volcanic and volcanic-sedimentary rocks of the Middle Devonian and Early Carboniferous. Mylonitic deformation is common in both the ore-bearing porphyries and the wall rocks, resulting in Cu-Mo mineralisation filled along the schistosity, or along cleavage and in the chalcopyrite-K-feldspar-quartz veins. According to the previous works, the tectonic evolution and mineralization process in the Kalaxianger porphyry Copper ore belt were summed up as following. Two period of medium-acidic porphyries were intruded in an island arc setting related to oceanic subduction in the Middle-Late Devonian and accompanied by large-scale Cu-Mo mineralization; then the ore belt went deformed, relocated and enriched for copper in the NW ductile shear zone in Early Carboniferous; With the formation of Hadanxun and Mayinebo A-type granites, the superimposed Cu mineralization occurred in the post-collisional stage in Late Carboniferous-Permian; In Mesozoic, another important superimposed mineralization was characterized by hydrothermal Cu ore veins.</td>

In this study, we focused on the six granitoid intrusions (named. as Kezibeiti, Zhebei, Basi, Kamusitai, Axi and Keluke respectively) in Tabei area, west section of the Taerbahatai-Sawuer district. After detailed geological and petrological investigation, these six granitoid intrusions are dated by the zircon LA-ICPMS U-Pb method, and their diagenetic ages are between 343 similar to 315Ma, which can be subdivided into 3 stages: early stage (343 similar to 338Ma); middle stage (328 similar to 324Ma) and late stage (315Ma). In the early stage, the granitoid intrusions (Kezibeiti and Zhebei plutons) are diorite, with alkaline peraluminous characters. In the middle stage, the granitoid intrusions (Basi, Kamusitai, and Axi plutons) are granitic diorite, with calc-alkaline-alkaline and metaluminous-peraluminous character. In the late stage, the granitoid intrusion (Keluke pluton) is granite, with alkaline and peraluminous characters. From the early stage to late stage, the evolution trending of granitoid intrusions Tabei area are higher K, Si content and lower Ca content, their magmatic source are generally crust with some-degree mantle materials; and stronger fractional crystallization and less crustal assimilation. The petrogenetic discriminative indicators shows that the two early-stage plutons are formed within Arc subduction environment (343 similar to 338Ma), while other four plutons are emplace with post-collisional environment (328 similar to 315Ma).</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The West Junggar strike-slip faulting tectonic system (WJTS) in northwestern China, is an eastward extending of the Balkhash orocline in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB), truncated by the right-lateral strike-slip Chingiz-Junggar fault during the Mesozoic. It is a domino-type tectonic system composed of the NE-extending left-lateral strike-slip Darabut, Mayile, and Baerluke faults and tectonic blocks among them, due to strike-slip fault-related folding of continental ribbons in the Late Paleozoic. The West Junggar metallogenic belt (WJMB), with the occurrence of some large and super-large deposits such as the Baogutu porphyry Cu, Hatu Au, Saertuohai Cr, and Yangzhuang Be deposits, is also an important metallogenic belt formed in the Late Paleozoic. In this paper, the characteristics of the WJTS and its relationship to the geochemical anomalies are analyzed. The results show that, the distribution of geochemical blocks, element anomalies, and the formation and distribution of the NE-extending WJMB and sub-belts, and Cu, Au, Mo, and Cr deposits, is controlled by the formation and evolution of the WJTS in the Late Paleozoic. Antisymmetric distribution of the Miaoergou-Hongshan plutons and the geochemical Au blocks, indicates the important modification and migration of the granitic plutons and element Au during the left-lateral strike-slip faulting along the Darabut fault. The circular rotational fault system surrounding the Miaoergou pluton, results in hotwheel-like distributions of the element anomalies of Cu, Pb, etc. Meanwhile, the distribution of Au deposits in the WJMB is controlled by the fracture zones in the fault system of the WJTS. The understanding of the relationship between tectonic system and geochemical anomalies will benefit the future exploration for mineral deposits in the WJMB.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Since the 1980s, many new ore deposits (or occurrences) have been found in the Sawuer region of the West Junggar, but the geological characteristics, spatial and temporal distribution, tectonic setting and metallogenic regularity of the deposits are poorly studied, which constraints the further exploration works. This paper summarized metallogenic regularity of the deposits in the Sawuer region based on the research of the ore deposits (occurrences) in this area, including the Tuerkubantao Cu-Ni ore spot, the Kuoerzhenkuola Au-Cu deposit, the Buerkesidai Au deposit, the Hanzheganeng Cu deposit, the Tasite Au deposit, the Heishantou Au ore spot, the Nalinkla Cu-Mo ore spot. According to the genetic type of ore deposits, the deposits in the Sawuer region can be divided as following: the magmatic Ni-Cu sulfide deposit, the porphyry-epithermal Au-Cu-Mo deposit, and the tectonic-altered rock type Au deposit related to intermediate-acid intrusive rocks. The metallogenic elements mainly include Au and Cu, followed by Cu-Ni and Mo. These deposits were formed in the Middle Devonian, the Early Carboniferous, the Late Carboniferous, and manly concentrated in the Early Carboniferous (354 similar to 336Ma). Spatially, the magmatic Ni-Cu sulfide deposits are distributed in the Kekesentao region of the northern Sawuer, the tectonic-altered rock type Au deposits related to intermediate-acid intrusive rocks are distributed in the northern Sawuer region, while the porphyry-epithermal Au-Cu-Mo deposits are located at the southern margin of the Sawuer region. The deposits in this area were formed in Middle Devonian island-arc setting, Early Carboniferous island-arc setting, and Late Carboniferous post-collision environment. The metallogenic regularity implies that the Sawuer region has potential for further prospecting. The mafic-ultramafic intrusion in the Kekesentao region of the northern Sawuer should be regarded as favorable exploration target of magmatic Cu-Ni sulfide deposit. There has potential to further prospecting for porphyry-epithermal Au deposits in the Kuoerzhenkuo-Buerkesidai area. The Late Carboniferous-Early Permian intermediate-acid intrusive rocks in the Sawuer region have potential to further prospecting for porphyry Cu-Mo deposits. The area which developed the Sawuer fault and its secondary fault is favorable exploration target of Au-Cu deposits.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Maikain large-size VMS Au-Ag-Cu-Zn-Pb deposit is located in the Baidaulet-Akbastau area in Central Kazakhstan. On the basis of detailed field profiling and thin-section petrography, we identified the main rock types in the Maikain area which are basic-intermediate volcanic and subvolcanic rocks. The mineralization is associated with intermediate volcanic rock. Based on our new geochemistry, two types are recognized: (1) Type I is tholeiitic to calc-alkaline basalts, andesites and gabbro-diabase and diabase, with REE patterns that are flat, and with a negative Nb anomaly and Th/Yb enrichment, indicating that they were generated above a subduction zone; (2) Type II is calc-alkaline andesite, which is strongly enriched in LREE with a negative Nb anomaly and Th/Yb enrichment, suggesting generation in a normal island-arc setting. Type II andesite is the host rock. The zircon Lu-Hf isotopic composition show that the zircon epsilon(Hf) (t) of Type II lava range from +4. 28 to +14. 84, suggesting that these melts were derived from mantle wedge above a subduction zone. The SIMS zircon U-Pb dating of Type II lava yields Late Ordovician age (459. 1 +/- 4. 8Ma). Therefore, the host rocks of the Maikain large-size VMS deposit are calc-alkaline andesites which formed in a normal island-arc setting in Late Ordovician. We propose that the Sharburti Mountains are the eastern extension of the Boshchekul-Chingiz porphyry-VMS ore belt of Kazakhstan into China. The Sharburti Mountains in the northern West Junggar have the magma condition and tectonic setting for VMS deposit.</td>

Due to the restricted conditions under which high-An plagioclase can form and preserve, it can help constrain the crystallization environment and petrogenesis of the host magma. High-An plagioclase (An(80-90)) bearing diorite outcrops in Baikouquan, West Junggar, Xinjiang. It was dated to be 316. 9 +/- 2. 9Ma (MSWD = 1. 5) by zircon SHRIMP. The high-An plagioclase occur as irregular patches in the predominant plagioclase of diorite. The major and trace elements and Sr-Nd isotopic data match the trend of the contemporary intrusions in this region. Detailed petrological and mineralogical studies demonstrate the high-An plagioclase are antecryst which belong to the magmatic system producing the host but are no directly consequence of the crystallization of the host. They came from an earlier pulse of magma and which are incorporated in a later pulse. Based on the Al-in-amphibole geobarometer, the diorite crystallized at 1. 2 similar to 2. 9kbar, which is compatible with the condition for the high-An plagioclase formation. The crystallization of high-An plagioclase in Baikouquan diorite suggests a H2O-rich and depleted primary magma, and has a profound implication on the magmatic system.</td>

The volcanic rocks are belong to sub-alkaline series, with SiO2 ranging from 51. 18% to 62. 48%, TiO2 ranging from 0. 60% to 1. 49%, total alkaline (K2O + Na2O) ranging from 1.26% to 6. 28%, Al2O3 ranging from 15. 53% to 18. 68%, MgO ranging from 2.64% to 7. 55%, and Mg(#)ranging from 41. 2 to 58. 5, and also showing relative rich in sodium, but poor in potassium. Moreover, all samples are characterized by higher rare earth elements (Sigma REE = 36. 21 x 10(-6) similar to 97. 10 x 10(-6)) and LREE enrichment ((La/Yb)(N) = 2. 88 similar to 6. 72), but weak negative Eu anomaly (Eu/Eu* =0. 74 similar to 1. 07). In addition, they display LILE enrichment (such as Rb, Ba, Th and K), HFSE depletion (Zr and Hf), obvious Nb and Ta negative anomalies, and slight Ti depletion. The results show geochemical characteristics of arc volcanic rocks as a whole, suggest that all the rocks from the Tielieketi Formation were derived from continental marginal arc setting with the source mainly affected by the fluid from the subduction zone, and weak crustal material contamination. The U-Pb zircon LA ICP-MS age of the tuff closely associated volcanic rocks is 363.3 +/- 4. 0Ma. These observations, in combination with previous work, indicate that the Boshchekul-Chingiz arc may sustain to the Late Devonian at least, furthermore, provides evidence for further understanding the property and tectonic evolution of the Boshchekul-Chingiz arc in the western Junggar.</td>

In this contribution, we report new results of the texture and formation age of the eastern Irtysh collision belt. The results reveal the following evidence; 1) the eastern Irtysh collision belt is consisted of four NW-NNW-trend vertical ductile deformation zones with an asymmetrical fan-like texture in transverse profiles and the strain pattern of apparent constriction and plane strain; 2) the ductile foliation zones have macroscopic to microscopic symmetric structures with cream-cake' style, and were possibly related to coaxial compression caused by the collision between the Altay terranee and Sawuer arc; and 3) the recrystallization zircons from the granodioritic mylonites and ultramylonite from the Yuleken and Laoshankou ductile deformation zone have a similar U-Pb ages of approximately 360Ma. This indicates that the Sawuer island arc had been collided with the Altay terrane in the Early Carboniferous at approximately 360Ma in the Kalaxiangar area.</td>

By high-precision SIMS zircon U-Pb dating, we obtained the concordant age of 422.0 +/- 1. 5Ma and 417.0 +/- 1. 7Ma for monzogranite and K-feldspar granite of Pantuoshan ore-bearing intrusion, and K-feldspar granite of Yingzuihongshan emplaced at age of 424.0 +/- 1. 3Ma. In addition, we have got the age of 280. 8 +/- 3. 0Ma of Yushan granite. The geochemical data shows that the three intrusions characterized by high REE and LREE-rich pattern, enriched LILE (Th, Zr, Hf) and HFSE (U, Pb), depleted HFSE (Ta, Nb, Ti, P). In combination with the evolution of the Paleozoic Beishan Orogenic Belt, we suggest that the Guoqing and Yingzuihongshan tungsten deposits occurred by the collision between Gongpoquan and Huaniushan island arc, and Yushan tungsten deposit formed in the Late Paleozoic back-arc extension tectonic setting.</td>

For years, Eastern Yunnan Province and Western Guizhou Province have been the new hot spots of CBM study in China. Predecessors have discussed CBM reservoir characteristics, CBM system, and geological process evolution. Basing on previous research, we studied the formation history of the CBM reservoir by numerical simulation at the Shuigonghe Syncline in Western Guizhou. Data were obtained from geological survey and laboratory testing. According to the simulation results, the CBM reservoir formation history can be divided into five stages. In addition, a plane distributive contour map of CBM reservoir formation-related data was constructed to recognize the change in CBM content and CBM dissipation quality at different stages in the region. Each stage has its feature on CBM generation, dissipation, and accumulation speed. Geological process controlling factors, including burial history, tectonic history, geothermal history, and maturation, were analyzed. All factors acted together and formed the CBM reservoir in the Shuigonghe Syncline. Among these factors, tectonic evolution history is the most important because it determines the whole generation-preservation-dissipation process of CBM. The other factors affect the process in various ways.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Soltan Maidan Complex is located in the eastern Alborz zone, Iran. Thickness of this complex ranges from 436 to 1,286 m and its age is Upper Ordovician-Silurian. It is the most important and voluminous Lower Paleozoic magmatic activity in Iran. This complex consists of mafic lava flows, agglomerates, and tuffs accompanied with some sedimentary intercalations. Field geology evidence indicate both subaerial and submarine eruptions during accumulation of this complex and also occurrence of a long-time exhumation event in the study area from Upper Ordovician to Middle Devonian time. The volcanic rocks of Soltan Maidan Complex indicate a range composition of basalt to basaltic-andesite and show transitional to alkaline nature of the primary magma along with evolution via fractional crystallization process. These rocks represent fairly high degrees of partial melting (between 14-20 %) from a common garnet peridotitic mantle source in an intra-continental rift setting. Relatively high Nb and Zr contents (i.e., 21.68 and 189.63 ppm, respectively) show the generation of magma from an enriched mantle source. Also, Th/La (with an average of 0.13) and Zr/Nb (with an average of 9.11) ratios of the samples illustrate mixing between an OIB-like magma with an EMI-type mantle source. The primary magma shows lack or minor role of the crustal contamination during its ascent. According to the many evidences, Soltan Maidan magmatism has occurred in the Upper Ordovician-Silurian times in relevant to a cycle of rift-related magmatic events and breakup of the northern margin of Gondwana in the process of Paleotethys development in the north of Iran.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The East Kunlun Orogenic Belt has undergone a composite orogenic process consisting of multiple orogenic cycles and involving many types of magmatic rocks spread over the whole district. However, due to bad natural geographical conditions and complex superimposed orogenic processes, most of the Caledonian orogenic traces were modified by the late tectonic uplift and denudation, so these rocks are poorly studied. Multiperiodic magmatic activity during the Late Silurian (approximately 420 Ma)-Late Devonian (approximately 380 Ma) exists in the Qimantagh area. We obtained 5 zircon U-Pb ages from the Late Silurian-Late Devonian granitoids in the Qimantagh area. Those ages are 420.6 +/- 2.6 Ma (Nalingguole biotite monzogranite), 421.2 +/- 1.9 Ma (Wulanwuzhuer potassium granite), 403.7 +/- 2.9 Ma (Yemaquan granodiorite), 391.3 +/- 3.2 Ma (Qunli granite porphyry), and 380.52 +/- 0.92 Ma (Kayakedengtage granodiorite). These granitoids belong to the sub-alkaline, high-K calc-alkaline, metaluminous or weakly or strongly peraluminous series. The rocks are right oblique types, having overall relative LREE enrichment and HREE depletion, though rocks from different times may exhibit different degrees of Eu anomalies or overall moderate Eu depletion. The rocks are rich in large ion lithophile elements (LILE), such as Rb, Th, and K, and high field strength elements (HFSE), such as Zr and Hf, and are depleted in Ba, Nb, Ta, Sr, P, Eu, and Ti. The rocks have complex composition sources. The Late Silurian granitoids are mainly crust-derived. Most of the Devonian granitoids are crust-mantle mixed-source and only some parts of them are crust-derived, especially the Middle Devonian granitoids. Those mid-acidic and acidic intrusive rocks are formed in a post-collision tectonic setting, lithosphere delamination may have occurred in the Early Devonian (407 Ma), and the study area subsequently experienced an underplating of the mantle-derived magma at least until the Late Devonian (380 Ma).</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Magnetic data provides basic information for geological and geophysical interpretation. In this study we compile recently collected (57 cruises survey) and old (published and open access) magnetic data. This compilation includes land, marine and aeromagnetic data acquired in the East Asia region. The newly acquired magnetic data are mainly concentrated mainly in the South China Sea (SCS) (especially in the northern continental shelf), the northwestern part of the West Philippine Basin (WPB), and the East China Sea. The updated magnetic dataset is gridded with a spacing of one arc-minute. The new magnetic map provides new insights into the tectonic setting of East Asia. Analysis of the compiled data reveals several regional anomaly patterns: (1) the NE-SW trending high positive magnetic anomaly zone extending from southwest Taiwan to the area about 114.5 degrees E and 22 degrees N is pronounced; but it is less continuous southwest of the Penghu islands. In addition, the orientation of this high linear magnetic zone changes slightly in 118.5 degrees E, 22.5 degrees N from N60 degrees E - N50 degrees E. (2) Between the Gagua Ridge (GR) and the Luzon-Okinawa Fracture Zone (LOFZ) the marine magnetic stripes of the WPB exhibit a NW-SE orientation. This suggests that the seafloor spreading could be related to the first stage of the WPB east of the LOFZ. (3) The Urdaneta and Amami plateaus are associated with high magnetization zones. These high magnetization zones extend northwestward and are subducting beneath the Ryukyu Trench.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Aim We explored the phylogenetic relationships of species of Mesalina, using one nuclear and two mitochondrial loci. This genus of lacertid lizards is widely distributed in North Africa and the Middle East and our goal was to develop a scenario capable of explaining the current distribution and evolutionary patterns within the genus in the context of the wider historical biogeography of the region.
   <br>Location North Africa and the Middle East.
   <br>Methods The assembled dataset consisted of 193 Mesalina individuals, representing 12 species distributed across the geographical range of the genus. Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods were used to support phylogenetic inferences on two mitochondrial (cytochrome b and 16S ribosomal RNA) and one nuclear (beta-fibrinogen intron 7) markers. Palaeogeographical and palaeoclimatic data were used to support the inferred phylogeographical patterns.
   <br>Results Mesalina lizards exhibit high genetic diversity and complex phylogenetic patterns, leading to an unsatisfactory systematic hypothesis of one paraphyletic and three polyphyletic traditional species. The estimated divergence times place the origin of the genus in the early Miocene (c. 22 Ma) and the divergence of most currently recognized species in the middle to late Miocene. The inferred ancestral distribution suggests that the genus and most of its species originated somewhere in Arabia or the Middle East, with the exception of the Mesalina olivieri complex, which may be of African origin.
   <br>Main conclusions Phylogenetic reconstruction based on the three loci studied suggests a higher than expected cryptic diversity of Mesalina in North Africa and the Middle East. We suggest that the tectonic movements of the Arabian plate, coupled with the climatic changes occurring since the Miocene, may be responsible for the phylogeographical patterns of North African and Middle Eastern Mesalina.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Aim Phylogeographical structure in the black salamander (Aneides flavipunctatus) was inferred using two independent genetic datasets. Concordance between the datasets was sought in order to evaluate earlier suggestions of species-level breaks and evidence of vicariance and long-term isolation within the complex. We hypothesized that major phylogeographical breaks would either correspond to current tectonic plate boundaries or to historical geological processes.
   <br>Location North-western California and southern Oregon (USA).
   <br>Methods Three mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genes were sequenced for 240 black salamanders from 136 localities, and up to 13 nuclear DNA loci were sequenced for 145 black salamanders representing 93 localities. Phylogenetic analysis of our mitochondrial dataset was performed to recover major lineages, while spatial clustering analysis of our nuclear dataset was utilized to identify points of concordance with our mtDNA phylogeny. Levels of gene flow were estimated for all contact zones.
   <br>Results Our mitochondrial phylogeny recovered four major lineages. Cluster analysis of our nuclear dataset is consistent with a four-population scheme, with the boundaries matching those of the mtDNA lineages. Gene flow across a contact zone in southern Humboldt between two of the populational units is extremely limited (2Nm &lt; 1). In what is identified as the Central Core population, two distinctive subpopulations were delineated based on nuclear data, but mitochondrial data are discordant.
   <br>Main conclusions The Aneides flavipunctatus complex comprises at least four species-level units. Two of the boundaries between these units are associated with current tectonic plate boundaries. The contact zone between our Northwest and Central Core populations lies adjacent to the Mendocino Triple Junction (MTJ), where the Humboldt and North American plates meet, while the area separating the Santa Cruz and Central Core populations corresponds to the boundary between the Pacific and Humboldt tectonic plates. The phylogeographical break within the Central Core population lies in a region in which uplift occurred that is associated with the historical position of the migrating MTJ.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Since its calibration, the Ti-in-quartz thermobarometer has been applied to a wide variety of geologic scenarios. The abundance of quartz in the continental crust and the involvement of silica in metamorphic reactions, deformation, and fluid flux processes make it a particularly powerful tool for constraining the pressure and temperature evolution of rocks, which is essential for developing tectonic models. Being able to quantitatively determine the solubility of Ti in quartz, however, is dependent upon being able to determine the activity of TiO2 in the rock during quartz growth or re-equilibration. Here we calculate TiO2 chemical potentials of the system relative to that of rutile (as a standard state), projected in P-T space for an average sub-aluminous pelite composition. Titania activities are calculated from these dependent potentials, with resultant activities used to correct for Ti isopleth projection in the Thomas et al. (2010) solubility equation. The modeling results are in good agreement with previous studies that suggest ilmenite-bearing assemblages buffer high TiO2 activities and titanite-bearing assemblages have much lower activities (&gt;= 0.5). At elevated temperatures, however, significant deviation from an assumed average pelite activity of 1.0 occurs, where the projected Ti concentration in quartz is up to 400 % different when assuming a dynamic system activity. This is due, in part, to the sequestering of Ti in biotite during heating and the destabilization of Tioxides at higher temperatures. With quartz-producing reactions, deformation-driven solution-transfer processes and other Si-mobilization events occur during the prograde and retrograde history of metapelites, and assuming TiO2 activities associated with the peak metamorphic paragenesis may be misleading and result in significant errors in P-T calculations.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>For the first time, a deep seismic data set acquired in the frame of the Algerian-French SPIRAL program provides new insights regarding the origin of the westernmost Algerian margin and basin. We performed a tomographic inversion of traveltimes along a 100-km-long wide-angle seismic profile shot over 40 ocean bottom seismometers offshore Mostaganem (Northwestern Algeria). The resulting velocity model and multichannel seismic reflection profiles show a thin (3-4 km thick) oceanic crust. The narrow ocean-continent transition (less than 10 km wide) is bounded by vertical faults and surmounted by a narrow almost continuous basin filled with Miocene to Quaternary sediments. This fault system, as well as the faults organized in a negative-flower structure on the continent side, marks a major strike-slip fault system. The extremely sharp variation of the Moho depth (up to 45 +/- 3 degrees) beneath the continental border underscores the absence of continental extension in this area. All these features support the hypothesis that this part of the margin from Oran to Tenes, trending N65-N70 degrees E, is a fossil subduction-transform edge propagator fault, vestige of the propagation of the edge of the Gibraltar subduction zone during the westward migration of the Alboran domain.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Earthworms belonging to the family Lumbricidae are extremely abundant in terrestrial temperate regions. They affect soil properties and nutrient cycling, thus shaping plant community composition and aboveground food webs. Some lumbricids are also model organisms in ecology and toxicology. Despite the intense research efforts dedicated to lumbricids over the last 130 years, the evolutionary relationships and taxonomic classification of these organisms are still subject to great debate. Resolution of their systematics is hampered by the structural simplicity of the earthworm body plan and the existence of cryptic species. We sampled 160 earthworm specimens belonging to 84 lumbricid species (28 genera) and 22 Lumbricoidea outgroups, sequenced two nuclear genes, four mitochondrial genes and seven mitochondrial tRNAs and examined 22 morphological characters. We then applied a combination of phylogenetic methods to generate the first robust genus-level phylogeny of the Lumbricidae. Our results show that the current Lumbricidae classification and the underlying hypotheses of character evolution must be revised. Our chronogram suggests that lumbricids emerged in the Lower Cretaceous in the holarctic region and that their diversification has been driven by tectonic processes (e.g. Laurasia split) and geographical isolation. Our chronogram and character reconstruction analysis reveal that spermathecae number does not follow a gradual pattern of reduction and that parthenogenesis arose from sexual relatives multiple times in the group; the same analysis also indicates that both epigeic and anecic earthworms evolved from endogeic ancestors. These findings emphasize the strong and multiple changes to which morphological and ecological characters are subjected, challenging the hypothesis of character stasis in Lumbricidae.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The elastic medium in lithosphere should be considered as discontinuities since the complex tectonic background has produced many active faults as separation. The Mohr-Coulomb Joint failure criterion with a constant friction coefficient, adopted in the original 3D discontinuous deformation analysis (DDA) method, cannot meet the requirement of highly accurate calculations for motion and deformation of tectonic block systems.
   <br>The rate- and state-friction laws, which are capable of reproducing virtually the entire range of observed fault behaviors, are combined into the 3D DDA method. Firstly, the formula of computing coefficient of friction on the interface with rate- and state friction laws is derived. In order to calculate the value of state variable theta, slip velocity V and friction coefficient it in every time step, a first-order differential equation about V is deduced. The increment of V is calculated by the second-order Taylor series expansion in our scheme. Secondly, the evolution law is determined by the Runge-Kutta scheme with adaptive step-size control. The friction submatrix, which consists of discrete forms of V and theta, is rewritten and then combined into the 3D DDA method. Finally, on the basis of reasonable geometry and mechanical properties of the numerical model, slide-hold-slide tests and velocity stepping tests are designed to examine the accuracy of the modified method.
   <br>Suits of numerical slide-hold-slide tests are performed using hold time from 1 to 10000 seconds and then we take the numerical test of the 10-second hold time as an example to make a brief illustration. A rigid block moves along the base in uniform linear motion at the first five seconds, because of the equality between friction and point loading. At the fifth second, the point loading is set to zero, and the friction strength drops immediately. After ten seconds, the block is reset as the previous loading. Strength increases, reaches a peak value and returns to its previous steady-state value subsequently. The numerical results are consistent with the laboratory data measured by Beeler et al. (1994) with a 0. 999-goodness of fits. Even though both data sets are mixed together, there is also a 0. 997-goodness of fits. In addition, the friction healing rate beta can be evaluated by the friction parameter b when the slip rate approximates to 0. The slope of these numerical data comes close to the b value of assumption with a 5% relative error. Besides, velocity stepping tests are also modeled using the improved 3D DDA. A slider keeps a steady sliding under a loading rate of 10 mu m/s with a distance of 25 mu m, and then decreases to 1 mu m/s during a characteristic distance. The results show a strong velocity dependence of friction which is consistent with laboratory data.
   <br>Comparison between numerical results and laboratory data shows that the 3D DDA method in combination with rata- and state-dependent friction laws is capable of simulating velocity dependence of sliding friction and time dependence of static friction, which resolves a basic problem when using 3D DDA in geodynamics research. The improved 3D DDA method still has the limitation such as unbalanced embedment due to the uncertainty of stiffness on the discontinuous interface, which leads to inexact results of contact force determination. In the future, this modification can be used in quantitative simulation of regional crustal deformation in combination with observations, such as GPS data.</td>

Based on this gravity data set, the gravity anomalies in different tectonic units are analyzed, the crustal density model along this profile is constructed, and the undulation and cross difference of density interfaces in crust and the distributional characteristics of faults around this profile are discussed.
   <br>The research results show that in the Ordos basin, the Bouguer gravity anomalies vary gently. The densities vary mainly in vertical direction. Interfaces are simple and smooth. And there are few faults. In the Weihe basin between the Qinling orogen and the Ordos basin, the Bouguer gravity anomalies are very low. There exists a gravity gradient belt corresponding to the big fault north of the middle Qinling oroge. The Moho interface uplift is about 10 km beneath this area. In the middle Qinling orogen, the Bouguer gravity anomalies vary strongly. Densities change in both lateral and vertical directions. The interfaces in crust are not so clear as those in its two sides. There are a lot of faults, and the Moho interface sinks a little. In the Sichuan basin, the Bouguer gravity anomalies vary smoothly. The density structure varies mainly in vertical direction. Interfaces are more simple and smooth, and there are few faults. These features are similar to those in the Ordos basin.
   <br>According to our research, there exist obvious differences between the middle Qinling orogen, Ordos basin and Sichuan basin in Bouguer gravity anomalies, crustal density models, undulation of interfaces in crust, and distribution of faults.
   <br>At last, this study suggests that the North Qinling fault and Ankang fault are the northern and southern contact zones of the middle Qinling orogen in the gravity profile. There exists a "basin-orogen-basin" distinctive tectonic system in the North China craton-middle Qinling orogen-Yangzi craton with its special resent characters of evolution.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Tectono-thermal modeling of rift basins is to calculate the thermal and subsidence history of a rift basin during its formation and evolution on a lithosphere scale, which links tectonic and thermal developments perfectly. However, most extension models have the following problems: assuming the lithosphere to be 125 km thick initially, considering heat conduction in the asthenosphere only, controversial setting of the upper boundary and rarely including thermal effects of sediments. Some effects on the tectono-thermal modeling are discussed, including the initial crustal and lithosphere thicknesses, the convection of asthenosphere and the upper boundary of the model. We also calculate the differences of rift flank uplift between water and sediment loading models.
   <br>The tectono-thermal modeling is based on a two-dimensional non-instantaneous extension model using the finite element algorithm in the Lagrangian system. By solving the heat conduction equation, the thermal history and tectonic subsidence history of the basin are modeled simultaneously.
   <br>The results are as follows: ( 1) Initial crustal and lithospheric thicknesses have great influence on tectono-thermal modeling, especially on the tectonic subsidence. (2) Compared to the model considering heat conduction in the asthenosphere only, the heat convection model has slower tectonic subsidence and thermal decay rates, and temperature from lower crust to the bottom of the model is significantly higher. (3) The fixed or Moving upper boundary during the modeling affects the calculated heat flow and tectonic subsidence in the thermal subsidence phase, and has remarkable influence on the temperature field. The effect increases with the increasing of the stretching factor. (4) Rift flank uplift of the water loading model would disappear within 200 Ma while the uplift would be stable at a certain value for the sediment loading model.
   <br>If the initial crustal and lithospheric thicknesses are uncertain in the modeling, sets of initial thicknesses should be given. The optimum initial crustal and lithospheric thicknesses can be determined when the calculated heat flow, Moho depth and lithospheric thickness fit observed values best. Pure heat conduction and pure heat convection in the asthenosphere are two limiting cases for extension models. In the rheological boundary layer, effects of both heat conduction and convection should be considered. For strong extensional areas, using the fixed upper boundary model would generate large calculation errors, especially in the temperature field. The thermal effect of sediment cannot be ignored when calculating the rift flank uplift.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Tiekelik Belt includes a large outcrop area of Precambrian continental crust, which is exposed along the southwestern margin of the Tarim Craton, NW China. It is characterized by the occurrence of highgrade metamorphic rocks and volcano-sedimentary successions. In this contribution, we present zircon U-Pb results from 10 samples of rocks from these volcano-sedimentary successions for provenance and age determinations, and geochemical analyses on basalts of the bimodal volcanic rocks from the Sailajiazitage Group. Four schist and paragneiss samples from the Ailiankate Group contain numerous zircons with ages of 650-850 Ma, suggesting that this group was deposited after the late Neoproterozoic and is not part of the Paleoproterozoic crystalline basement of the Tarim Craton as previously believed. One sample collected from marble of the Bochatetage Formation suggests a depositional age below 773 Ma. Three sandstone samples from the Sukuluoke and Qiakemaklike formations contain zircon ranging in ages from 630 Ma to 830 Ma, suggesting deposition of these formations after the Ediacaran. One andesite clast from the Qiakemaklike conglomerate gave a (206)pb/U-238 age of 793 +/- 5 Ma, while a rhyolite from the Sailajiazitage Group gave a Pb-206/U-238 age of 881 +/- 6 Ma. The basalts of the bimodal volcanic rocks from the Sailajiazitage Group show enrichment of light rare earth elements (La-N/Yb-N =4.92-8.51) and high field strength elements (HFSE) (e.g. Nb, Zr and Ti), similar to continental flood basalts (CFB), indicating bimodal volcanism in a within-plate tectonic setting.
   <br>Our new data, combined with previous sedimentary facies analysis, suggest the presence of a large Neoproterozoic volcano-sedimentary rift basin. This rift basin records the change from a fluviolacustrine to a marine environment along the southwestern margin of the Tarim Craton. The zircon U-Pb ages indicate initial rifting at 880 Ma, followed by extensive rifting at similar to 790 Ma. The detrital zircons of the Tiekelik Belt are dominated by four populations of Neoproterozoic (630-670 Ma, ca. 740-745 Ma, ca. 785 Ma, and ca. 800-850 Ma), with some Paleoproterozoic and Archean grains (2800-1800 Ma). The major detrital zircon populations approximately match the ages of widespread magmatism documented along the northern margin of the Tarim Craton. We consider that sourcing of these components from the northern Tarim could explain the age probability patterns of the Tiekelik Neoproterozoic sediments. We speculate that this process might be linked to far-field tectonics causing uplift and erosion of the northern Tarim rocks and predominantly large-scale southwards transport of sediments over the craton. The rifting environment of the sedimentary basin in the Tiekelik Belt, however, suggests a bidirectional source. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Chagangnuoer deposit is a typical submarine volcanic rock-hosted skarn iron deposit, where orebodies mainly occur in andesitic rocks of the Dahalajunshan Formation (DF) with skarns well developed around orebodies. The volcanic rocks of the DF in the Chagangnuoer deposit display calc-alkaline characteristics. The ore-bearing andesitic rocks have high Sr-87/Sr-86((i)) (0.7058-0.7117) and low epsilon (Nd)(t) (-3.51 to 1.67). They probably formed through mixing of basaltic melts and the induced crustal melts. LA-ICP-MS U-Pb zircon ages of 250 and 305 Ma are obtained for the granite and granodiorite in the Chagangnuoer deposit, respectively, which are significantly younger than the timing of the skarn formation (316 Ma). These age data indicate that the granitoids have no contribution to the skarn and associated iron mineralization. This paper proposes a new genetic model for submarine volcanic rock-hosted skarn iron deposits, in which the iron mineralization, skarn formation and volcanic magmatism are necessary aspects of the same system; the iron separates and concentrates from the silicate magma in the form of Fe(II) carbonate complex. While this conceptual model is largely based on observations on the Chagangnuoer deposit, it may have general significance for skarn-type iron deposits associated with submarine volcanic rock sequences and warrants further testing and improvement.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The structure and dynamics in SE Tibet are the key to understand the tectonic evolution of the Tibetan Plateau. In this study we determined high-resolution P-wave seismic images in the upper mantle and transition zone in SE Tibet by jointly inverting the travel-time residuals of local events and the relative travel-time residuals of teleseismic events recorded by very dense seismic stations. We revealed a high-velocity body in the upper mantle beneath South China that represents the root of the Yangtze Craton. The high-velocity body extends in the entire Yangtze Craton at 300-450 km depths, but it is constrained just beneath the Sichuan Basin and surrounded by extensive low-velocity zones to the southwest at 65-250 km depths. We propose that the Yangtze Craton is destructed laterally by the mantle flow extruded from the Tibetan Plateau. We obtain a low-velocity column in the upper mantle under the Tengchong volcano as well as the visible high-velocity bodies in the upper mantle and transition zone below the low-velocity column. The images suggest that the Tengchong volcano is closely related to the subduction of the Burma plate and caused by the dehydration of the subducted slab. The present study reveals unprecedented details of the mantle structures beneath SE Tibet and provides new insights into the geodynamics of the Tibetan Plateau and its interaction with the stable Yangtze Craton.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Mantle volatiles are mainly lost from the Earth to the atmosphere through subaerial and submarine volcanism. Recent studies have shown that degassing of mantle volatiles also occurs from inactive volcanic areas and in tectonically active areas. A new challenge in Earth science is to quantify the mantle-derived flux of volatiles (e.g., CO2) which is important for understanding such diverse issues as the evolution of the atmosphere, the relationships between magma degassing and volcanic activity, gas pressure and seismogenic processes, and the hazards posed by volcanic lakes. Here we present a detailed study of mantle-derived CO2 budget from Mt. Vulture volcano in the Apennines, Italy, whose latest eruption occurred 141 +/- 11 kyr ago.
   <br>The relationship between delta C-13(CO2) and total dissolved carbon at Mt. Vulture volcano indicates that the emitted CO2 is a mixture of a biogenic end-member with an average delta C-13(CO2) of about -17 parts per thousand and a mantle-derived CO2 end-member with delta C-13(CO2) values from -3 parts per thousand to +2 parts per thousand. These values of mantle-derived delta C-13(CO2) are in the range of those for gas emitted from active volcanoes in the Mediterranean. We calculated the contribution of individual components (CO2 in groundwater, in lakes and from main pools) to the total CO2 budget in the area. We used new measurements of water flow, combined with literature data, to calculate the CO2 flux associated with groundwater, and measured the gas flux from the main pools on the volcanic edifice. Finally, we calculated the CO2 flow in the lakes based on the gradient concentration and eddy diffusivity. The total mantle-derived CO2 budget in the area is 4.85 x 10(8) mol yr(-1), which is more than double previous estimates. This is higher than those observed in younger volcanic systems elsewhere, thereby supporting the existence of actively degassing mantle melts below Mt. Vulture volcano.
   <br>A structural map highlights the tectonic control on CO2 flow across the Mt. Vulture volcanic edifice. Indeed, the tectonic discontinuities that controlled the magma upwelling during the most recent volcanic activity are still the main active degassing structures.
   <br>The new estimate of CO2 budget in the Mt. Vulture area, together with literature data on CO2 budget from historically active and inactive Italian volcanoes, suggests a power-law functional relationship between the age of the most recent volcanic eruption and both total discharged CO2 (R-2 = 0.73) and volcano size-normalized CO2 flux (R-2 = 0.66). This relation is also valid by using data from worldwide volcanoes highlighting that deep degassing can occur over very long time too. In turn, the highlighted relation provides also an important tool to better evaluate the state of activity of a volcano, whose last activity occurred far in time.
   <br>Finally, our study highlights that in the southern Apennines, an active degassing of mantle-derived volatiles (i.e., He, CO2) occurs indiscriminately from west to east. This is in contrast to the central-northern Apennine, which is characterized by a crustal radiogenic volatile contribution, which increases eastward, coupled to a decrease in deep CO2 flux. This difference between the two regions is probably due to lithospheric tears which control the upwelling of mantle melts, their degassing and the transport of volatiles through the crust.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Alluvial fans and terraces develop in diverse regions responding to different tectonic and climatic conditions. The Motozintla basin is located in the State of Chiapas, southern Mexico and has an E-W orientation following the trace of the left-lateral Polochic Fault. The evolution of the Motozintla basin and the alluvial plain is related to several factors, such as fault movement, intense erosion by hydrometeorological events, and anthropogenic activity. This study presents the geomorphology of the alluvial plain that between the villages of Motozintla and Mazapa de Juarez exposes 31 alluvial fans, 5 hanging terraces and 13 ramps. Fourteen of these alluvial fans have been truncated by the Polochic fault, exposing maximum uplifts of similar to 12 m. The internal structure of truncated fans consists of single massive beds (monolithologic fans) or stacked beds (polygenetic fans). The fans' stratigraphy is made of debris flow deposits separated by paleosols and minor hyperconcentrated flows, fluviatile beds, and pyroclastic fall deposits. The reconstruction of the stratigraphy assisted by radiocarbon geochronology suggests that these fans have been active since late Pleistocene (25 ka) to the present. This record suggests that at least 10 events have been recorded at the fan interior during the past similar to 1840 years. One of these events at 355 +/- 65 C-14 yrs. BP (cal yrs. AD 1438 to 1652) can be correlated across the fans and is likely associated with an extreme hydrometeorologic event. The presence of a 165 +/- 60 C-14 yrs. BP (cal yrs. AD 1652-1949) debris flow deposit within the fans suggests that movement along the Polochic fault formed the fans' scarp afterwards. In fact, a historic earthquake along the fault occurred east of Motozintla on July 22, 1816 with a M-w of 7.5-7.75. Recent catastrophic floods have affected Motozintla in 1998 and 2005 induced by extreme hydrometeorological events and anthropogenic factors. Therefore, scenarios for Motozintla involved several types of mass movement processes that pose a serious hazard and threat to the inhabitants of the region. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Tengchong volcanic field east of the Burma arc in SW China comprises numerous Quaternary volcanoes. The volcanic rocks can be grouped into four units, numbered 1-4 from oldest to youngest. Units 1,3 and 4 are composed of trachybasalt, basaltic trachyandesite and trachyandesite, respectively, whereas Unit 2 consists of hornblende dacite. Primary minerals in the dacite include plagioclase, clinopyroxene, amphibole and magnetite, all set in a glassy groundmass. Some of the dacites are moderately to highly weathered and show effects of low temperature alteration, with loss on ignition (LOI) up to 9.6 wt% and positive correlations of LOI with Al2O3, but negative correlations with SiO2, CaO and Na2O. Fresh dacites (LOI &lt;3 wt%) belong to the calk-alkaline series and have pronounced negative Ti, Nb and Ta anomalies. They have whole-rock Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios ranging from 0.7090 to 0.7101, epsilon Nd values from -10.8 to -11.8, and epsilon Hf values from -5.1 to -6.8. Many of the large plagioclase crystals in the fresh dacites have reverse zoning, ranging from An(55) in the cores to An(72) in the rims. The smaller phenocrysts have relatively uniform An values between 56 and 50. One plagioclase crystal has an An value of 33.5.
   <br>Plagioclase in the fresh dacite has relatively high Sr contents and Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios ranging from 0.7050 to 07125 except for one value of 0.7516, whereas plagioclase in the altered dacite has low Sr contents and highly variable Sr isotopic compositions (0.7039-0.7138), indistinguishable from those of the fresh rocks.
   <br>Both An values and Sr isotopic compositions of the plagioclase indicate mixing of mantle- and crustally-derived magmas. We therefore propose that mantle-derived basaltic magma caused partial melting of the lower-middle crust and that mixing of the mafic and felsic magmas produced the dacite in staging magma chambers. The dacites contain minerals crystallized from both the mafic and felsic magmas, as well as a few xenocrysts plucked from the country rocks. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, the Longmen Shan, has triggered a vigorous debate to explain the uplift and maintaining of its steep and high topography. Several mechanical and kinematic models have been previously developed in order to investigate the tectonic and erosional control on the formation mechanism of the Longmen Shan. But the contribution of crustal shortening has never been taken into account due to the lack of significant surface convergence rate (about 3 mm/a) across the Longmen Shan range. We investigate this question through 2D finite element modelling assuming visco-elasticity rheology. The numerical results are constrained with geological and geophysical observations across the Longmen Shan range. We find that even low rate of crustal shortening contributes significantly to the uplift of the Longmen Shan. This contribution has been greatly underestimated in previous studies. The viscosity contrast between the Tibetan Plateau lower crust and the Yangtze crust crucially controls the uplift of the Longmen Shan due to crustal shortening. The ductile Tibetan lower crust thickens to accommodate most of crust shortening, as the eastward movement of the Tibetan Plateau is obstructed by the mechanical strong and stable Yangtze craton. The uplift rate contrast between the Tibetan Plateau and the Sichuan causes a steep uplift rate gradient to produce and maintain the Longmen Shan steep and high topography in the time scale of several million years. Our results support a possible explanation for the paradox of the high topography and low convergence rate at the Longmen Shan range. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Precambrian basement in the Jiaobei terrane is largely composed of Tonalite-Trondhjemite-Granodiorite (TTG) suite of rocks and offers important insights into the crustal evolution history of the North China Craton (NCC). The LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb age data presented in this study show that the magmatic protoliths of the TTG gneisses formed during 2508-2547 Ma and recorded the Paleoproterozoic metamorphism (similar to 1905 Ma). The rocks are enriched in LILE (Rb, Ba and Sr) and depleted in HFSE (Nb, Ta, Zr and Hf). They are characterized by high Sr contents (406-2906 ppm), Sr/Y ratios (31.3-355) and subchondritic Nb/Ta ratios (18.5-68.9). The TTGs show relatively high Sigma REE contents (72.0-266 ppm) with strongly enriched LREE ((La/Yb)(N) = 11.5-121) and positive or negligible negative Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu* = 0.84-1.89). These geochemical features suggest that the magma source might have been rutile-bearing amphibole eclogite. Their high Mg-# (42-56) and high Cr (153-285 ppm) and Ni contents (22.2-74.5 ppm) indicate interaction with the mantle wedge during magma ascent. The whole rock epsilon Nd (t) values (+2.6 to +3.8) and most of the magmatic zircon epsilon(Hf) (t) values (+1.3 to +7.6) suggest juvenile to evolved isotopic signatures. All these lines of evidence suggest that the TTG rocks in this study formed through partial melting of subducted oceanic slab in a continental arc environment. The drill holes in the Jiaobei terrane are dominated by similar to 2.5 Ga TTG gneisses, suggesting that the TTG magma at similar to 2.5 Ga is more widely distributed deep underground than that of similar to 2.7-2.9 Ga, at least within the approachable depth range of our research. Some zircon grains from Jiaobei TTGs give high epsilon(Hf) (t) values plotting above the curve of 0.75 * epsilon(Hf) of DM, and their T-DM(C) ages are very close to the time of the zircon crystallization. However, the majority of the epsilon(Hf)(t) values fall below the curve of 0.75 * epsilon(Hf) of DM and their T-DM(C) ages are concentrated between similar to 2.7-2.9 Ga. Therefore, combining with other related studies, we propose that the -2.5-2.6 Ga magmatism in the NCC probably represents a coherent event of crustal growth and major reworking (remelting).

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Erzincan pull-apart basin is located in the eastern section of the North Anatolian Fault System (NAFS). The tectonic evolution of this basin is mostly controlled by strike slip master faults of the NAFS. This study examines the topography structure relationships in an effort to evaluate the tectonic signatures in the landscape, paying special attention to recent tectonic activity. In the study, the main focus is on the tectonic controls of the NAFS on the geomorphic evolution of alluvial fans and fan catchments in the Erzincan pull-apart basin. The observations of the amount of tilting of the alluvial fans (3) and its relation with morphometric (Asymmetry Factor (AF), Hypsometric Integral (HI), Fractal analysis of drainage networks (D)) properties of the fan catchments provide valuable information about the tectonic evolution of the basin area. The results of the analyses showed that the alluvial fan and fan catchment morphology in the pull-apart basin are mainly controlled by the ongoing tectonic activity of the NAFS. The fault system in the basin has controlled the accommodation space by causing differential subsidence of the basin, and aggradation processes by causing channel migration, channel incision and tilting the alluvial fans.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The southeastern margin of the Yangtze Block is a suitable region to decipher Neoproterozoic to Early Paleozoic polyorogenic deformation of the South China Block. Based on 1:50,000-scale geological mapping, four deformational phases were identified through structural analysis and Ar-40/Ar-39 dating. The earliest event (D-1) corresponds to nearly E-W-striking folding and top-to-the south thrusting, developed during Neoproterozoic orogeny caused by the collision between the Yangtze Block and the Cathaysia Block. The D-2 event is characterized by the nearly E-W-striking top-to-the north thrusting. The D-3 deformation is marked by the NNE-striking folding, thrusting and dextral shearing. The D-3 structures constitute a positive flower pattern, with opposing kinematics, rooted in the Jiangwan dextral shear zone. The D-4 event is the nearly E-W-striking ductile dextral shearing. Ar-40/Ar-39 geochronology shows that the NNE-trending dextral shearing and the nearly E-W-striking dextral shearing occurred at 449 +/- 4 Ma and 429 +/- 3 Ma, respectively. Combining with previous geochronology, all the D-2, D-3, D-4 events are related to the Early Paleozoic orogeny. Both the D-2 top-to-the north thrusts and D-3 NNE-striking positive flower structures are syn-orogenic products. These incompatible syn-orogenic structures indicate that the orientation of the principal stress changed from the N-S-striking to E-W-striking at similar to 450 Ma. The nearly E-W-striking ductile dextral shearing (D-4) is the outcome of post-orogeny. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Upper Permian to Lower Triassic siliciclastic succession in the Shiwandashan Basin, South China, accumulated in response to a Permo-Triassic orogeny (often referred to as the Indosinian orogeny). The petrology, geochemistry and geochronology of this succession, along with north and northwest-directed paleocurrent indicators, reveal an evolving provenance related to erosion and reworking of Precambrian, Early Paleozoic and Permian to Early Triassic units exposed to the south of the basin. The Upper Permian to Lower Triassic sandstones within the basin are quartz dominated, which along with their high Th/Sc and Zr/Sc ratios indicate a multi-cycled source. Sandstone clasts in the Upper Permian conglomerates display age patterns similar to nearby Silurian strata. Other clast types (limestone, mudstone and cherts) are from the Early Paleozoic strata within or adjoining the basin. Detrital zircon age spectra of the strata display prominent age groups at 1200-800 Ma, 650-500 Ma and 460-420 Ma, and are inferred to have been derived from basement units similar to those exposed in the Yunkai Massif to the south and southeast of the Shiwandashan Basin and/or from reworking of the Paleozoic units around the basin. The Lower Triassic strata also contain 260-240 Ma zircons that were likely derived from magmatic rocks located to the south of the basin. The Late Permian marks a significant change in the paleogeography of the Shiwandashan Basin from an older deep marine chert succession to a terrestrial to shallow marine environment receiving an influx of clastic detritus related to uplift and erosion to the south of the basin. The Lower Triassic units within the basin record a further pulse of sediment influx including detritus derived from approximately syn-sedimentary magmatic activity. Yunkai Massif, located in the southeast of the basin, underwent uplift in Late Permian and provided majority detritus for the basin in the Late Permian to Early Triassic. Integration of provenance data with regional geological information, magmatic and metamorphic records to the south of the Shiwandashan Basin suggests the basin was converted from a pre-Late Permian deep marine extensional basin to a Late Permian to Early Triassic foreland basin. Conversion to a foreland basin reflected collision between the South China and Indochina blocks. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Geometric and kinematic analyses were conducted on a fault zone at a construction site in SE Korea to understand its temporal and spatial evolution. This area is tectonically characterized by the existence of reversely reactivated faults associated with Cenozoic tectonic inversion. Structural elements within fault core such as slip surfaces and gouge zones are examined in a great detail based on grid-mapping analysis in a nearly three-dimension, combining the vertical sections with various directions. The highly deformed zone is composed of multiple gouge zones and geometrically characterized by anastomosing patterns. Kinematic indicators and their cross-cutting relationships indicate that the fault zone evolved by multiple slip events including reverse reactivation of a pre-existing normal fault zone. This implies that tectonic inversion is one of the most important factors controlling the complexity of the architecture of the studied fault zone, and it is important to understand the evolutional history of mature (or evolved) faults. Detailed analysis of geometric and kinematic characteristics of mature fault zones can provide very useful information to various research fields, such as fault zone evolution, interpretation of local tectonics, geotechnical stability, and fault zone modeling associated with fluid flow.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The right-stepping en-echelon Kunbei fault system, consisting of the Hongliuquan, Arlar, XIII, and Kunbei faults, features importantly in the tectonic evolution of the southwest Qaidam basin. The 3D seismic cross-section interpretation and key horizon similarity attribute analysis show that the NWW-striking Arlar fault is composed of two steeply dipping faults (F1 and F2) in cross-sectional view, and branches eastward into two west-dipping faults (F5 and F6) in map view. The fact that the strata above T-2 (the base of the early Miocene Xiayoushashan Formation) become dramatically thinner toward the high points of the Arlar fault suggests an early Miocene initiation (ca. 22,0 Ma) for this fault. As indicated by the windowed amplitude-related attribute maps, the Arlar fault and F5 (one branch of the Arlar fault) have cumulative sinistral offsets of similar to 8.6-8.7 km and similar to 5.2-5.4 km, respectively. These considerably greater strike-slip components, in conjunction with the respective maximum true dip-slip displacements of &lt;2.2 km and &lt;1.5 km, convincingly demonstrate that the Arlar fault and F5 are two predominantly left-lateral strike-slip faults. The other faults in the Kunbei fault system are similarly of strike-slip types. This means that the southern boundary of the Qaidam basin is not governed by south- or north-directed thrusting but rather strike-slip faulting, implying that the Qaidam basin is not a foreland basin of the Eastern Kunlun Range. Taking the Altyn Tagh fault into account, the Qaidam basin is essentially a strike-slip superimposed basin developing between two large left-lateral strike-slip faults. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>A number of Late Mesozoic (similar to 130 Ma) A-type granitic plutons have been identified in Southeast China. Here we investigate the petrogenesis of one of these granitic plutons in Southeast China, the Sanqingshan-Damaoshan (SD) granites in northeastern Jiangxi Province, using zircon U-Pb geochronology, Hf isotopic analyses, and major and trace element analyses. The SD granites are metaluminous to weakly peraluminous and show typical A-type affinity, which is characterized by high SiO2, Na2O + K2O, rare earth element (REE), high field strength element (HFSE) contents, Ga/Al and Fe-# [FeOV(FeOt + MgO)] values. Zircon grains from the SD granites and some other similar to 130 Ma A-type granites commonly contain oscillatory zoning "cores" surrounded by unzoned to weakly zoned "rims". Detailed studies of zircons from the SD granites show that "rims" are enriched in LREE, Th and U compared with "cores". Chondrite-normalized REE patterns of the "cores" increase steeply from La to Lu and show pronounced Ce and Eu anomalies, while REE patterns of the "rims" display higher REE abundances with flatter LREE patterns and moderate Ce anomalies. Nevertheless, Lu-Hf isotopic analyses and Ti-in zircon thermometer show similar characteristics between "rims" and "cores", indicating that the "rims" may crystallize under the effect of internal magmatic hydrothermal fluids. U-rich "rims" are more susceptible to Pb loss caused by self-irradiation, which may lead to significant younger U-Pb ages. As a result, U-Pb ages of zircon "cores" (similar to 130 Ma) represent crystallization ages of the SD granites. epsilon(Hf)(t) values of zircon grains from the SD granites are between -6.4 and -0.4 with Mesoproterozoic model ages (T-2DM) ranging from 1.22 to 1.59 Ga, suggesting that the granites may be formed by partial melting of Proterozoic basement. Compared with other adjacent similar to 130 Ma A-type granitic plutons in SE China, the SD granites have similar geochemical characteristics and Hf isotopic compositions to those of Xiangshan, Daqiaowu, Yangmeiwan, and Tongshan granites, but different from the Baijuhuajian granite. epsilon(Hf)(t) values of the Baijuhuajian granites are higher than other granites, indicating significant participation of juvenile materials. These similar to 130 Ma A-type granites indicate a back-arc extension setting due to the roll-back of paleo-Pacific plate, where the crust and lithospheric mantle became progressively thinned. The upwelling of asthenosphere triggered the partial melting of crustal rocks and generated the Sanqingshan-Damaoshan, Tongshan, Daqiaowu and Yangmeiwan granitic plutons. With ongoing back-arc extension and increased subduction angle during the roll-back of subducted paleo-Pacific slab, the back-arc extension gradually intensified, resulting in significant additions of mantle juvenile materials to the crustal magma and the formation of the Baijuhuajian granite.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The timing and source of magmatism that formed Early Cretaceous dolerite dykes in the Tancheng-Lujiang (Tan-Lu) Fault area of the southeastern North China Craton was determined using geochronological, geochemical, and whole-rock Sr-Nd isotopic data. Laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass (LA-ICP-MS) spectrometry U-Pb analysis of zircon yielded consistent ages of 129.6 +/- 0.7, 126.8 +/- 0.7, 125.5 +/- 0.7, 124.9 +/- 0.9, 126.4 +/- 0.7, and 125.5 +/- 0.7 Ma for six samples of the mafic dykes within the NCC. The K2O + Na2O concentrations (5.02-5.21 wt.%) of the dykes indicate they are alkaline and these dykes have K2O concentrations (2.35-2.48 wt.%) that indicate they are shoshonitic. These dolerites are also characterized by high and wide ranging (La/Yb)(N) (14.5-36.0), have slightly negative Eu anomalies (delta Eu = 0.70-0.91) and positive Ba, U, K, and Pb anomalies, and are depleted in the high field strength elements (Nb, Ta, P, and Ti). In addition, these mafic dykes are characterized by high radiogenic Sr [(Sr-87/Sr-86)(1) = 0.7099-0.7100] and negative epsilon(Nd) (t) values (-14.4 to -13.7). These data suggest that the magmas that formed the dykes were derived through the partial melting (12.0-15.0%) of an enriched region of the mantle that was hybridized during interaction with subducted sedimentary rocks from the Yangtze Craton. The parental magmas then fractionated olivine and Fe-Ti oxides during ascent and underwent negligible crustal contamination during magma emplacement. These mafic magmas were finally emplaced as dyke swarms associated with lithospheric extension. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Late Silurian-Carboniferous extensional structures have been discovered after careful interpretation of seismic reflection data in western Manjiaer Sag, Central Tarim Basin in central Asia. The extensional structures comprise numerous small normal faults in nearly N-S strike direction. Groups of normal faults in profile show features suggestive of negative flower structures and small horst-graben structures. Based on growth index calculation, these extensional structures formed in the Late Silurian period, continued activity in the Devonian and Carboniferous and then ceased at the end of Carboniferous. The peak-stage of normal fault activity occurred in Late Silurian. Late Silurian-Carboniferous normal faults also developed in the Tazhong and Tabei areas, which implies that Tarim Basin were under regional extensional tectonic setting during that periods. The extensional structure in southern Tarim resulted from the post-orogeny stress relaxation of the Kunlun Early Paleozoic orogenic belt, and those in northern Tarim resulted from the Paleozoic back-arc rifting which led to the opening of South Tianshan ocean.

Zircon LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating yields ages of 208.7 +/- 0.7 Ma and 209.3 +/- 0.9 Ma for the host monzogranites, and 211.9 +/- 0.8 Ma for the MMEs, indicating formation from coeval magmas. The field occurrence and textures including spheroidal shapes, transitional contacts, igneous mineral assemblages, acicular apatites, and oscillatory zoning with repeated resorption surfaces in plagioclase, indicate that the MMEs crystallized from mafic magma that was injected into and mingled with the host felsic magma. The host monzogranites are intermediate-felsic, metaluminous, and lack typical peraluminous minerals or alkaline mafic minerals, suggesting their I-type affinity. The monzogranites display depletion in high field strength elements, with Nb and Ta anomalies, and enrichment in large ion lithophile elements and light rare earth elements (LREE), with slightly negative Eu anomalies (Eu/ Eu* = 0.72-0.93). The MMEs from the Yangba pluton are intermediate, metaluminous, and have higher K2O, Al2O3, Fe2O3T, MgO, Ni, and Cr contents than the pluton. The MMEs also display much higher total rare earth element (REE) concentrations and REE patterns that are sub-parallel to those of the host rocks, enrichments in Rb, Th, U, K, and LREE, and depletions in Ba, Nb, Ta, and Ti. These features are similar to those of the host rocks, indicating crust-mantle interaction during their petrogenesis.
   <br>Zircons from the MMEs have highly variable epsilon(Hf)(t) values (-5.5 to +8.7) with corresponding two-stage Hf model ages (T-DM2) of 1.14 to 1.42 Ga, indicating they were derived from depleted mantle with crustal contamination. In contrast, zircons from host monzogranite show epsilon(Hf)(t) values ranging from 1.7 to +2.7, with T-Dm2 of 1.13 to 1.21 Ga, corresponding to that of the basement rocks in the Bikou Terrane, which indicates that these granitic magmas were probably derived from the Neoproterozoic juvenile lower crust with minor contribution of Mesoproterozoic ancient lower crust.
   <br>The integrated petrology and elemental and isotopic geochemistry suggest that the MMEs and host monzogranites were generated by the interaction of a granitic magma and a mafic magma in the lower crust. We envisage that Neoproterozoic subcontinental lithosphere mantle-derived mafic magma intruded the lower continental crust during Late Triassic, following the Late Permian to Early Triassic collision between the South China and North China Blocks.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Loei Fold Belt, located at the western margin of the Indochina Block, is considered to be tectonically linked to the subduction of the Paleotethyan Ocean and subsequent collision. In northwestern Laos, the volcanic rocks are traditionally mapped as Permian-Early Triassic sequences. Our LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating results show that andesitic, rhyolitic and tuffaceous samples from the Muang Feuang region of the Loei Fold Belt have zircon U-Pb ages of 330.4 +/- 2.2 Ma, 334.9 +/- 1.7 Ma and 349.6 +/- 1.7 Ma, which are interpreted as their eruption ages, respectively. These ages are indicative of an Early Carboniferous origin. The basaltic and basaltic-andesitic samples from the Pak Lay region yield zircon U-Pb ages of 314.6 +/- 2.7 Ma and 315.4 +/- 3.8 Ma, respectively, and have a Late Carboniferous origin. These samples exhibit depletion in HFSEs (e.g., Nb, Ta, Ti) with high LILE/FIFSE ratios and exhibit a geochemical affinity to continental arc volcanic rocks. These signatures suggest the presence of an Early to Late Carboniferous active continental margin along the western margin of the Indochina Block. The Loei Fold Belt may extend north into NW Laos.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The North China Craton (NCC) has been flanked by the North Qilian and North Qinling arc-accretionary belts to the south and southwest since similar to 400 Ma. The part of the NCC to the east of the Alax terrane (E-NCC) experienced a long sedimentary hiatus and tectonic quiescence between the Middle Ordovician and the late Carboniferous. The northern margin of the E-NCC was reactivated and uplifted with contemporaneous volcanism during the late Carboniferous, an event that partly induced the transformation of the E-NCC from an erosional platform to a continental sedimentary basin. However, the factors controlling this transformation are still not fully understood. A series of sedimentary rocks overlying Ordovician carbonates in the southwestern E-NCC contains a lower iron-oxide layer and an upper phyllosilicate layer. Detrital zircons from different parts of the profile, from the base to the top of the two layers, have similar U-Pb ages. These zircons have a minimum age of ca. 300 Ma and a prominent peak at ca. 450 Ma, with subordinate peaks at ca. 1000 and 2500 Ma. The near-identical minimum age for the two layers suggests they were semi-simultaneously deposited in the late Carboniferous after the long hiatus in sedimentation. Detrital zircons with ages of similar to 450 Ma have initial Hf isotopic compositions that vary from large negative to elevated positive. These data, together with the trace element compositions of these zircons, indicate that these minerals formed in a continental arc environment. Samples from the upper sedimentary layer contain mica group minerals that are weakly buckled and fractured, and have weathered to form clay minerals, including chlorite and illite. This suggests that the protolith of this sedimentary layer was dominated by mica schist or mica-bearing granitoid that most likely located near the adjoined part between the North Qilian and North Qinling arc-accretionary belts. Detrital zircons with the youngest ages (ca. 300 Ma) were considered to derive from the northern marginal region of the E-NCC, an area characterized by contemporaneous volcanism. The co-existence of the 450 and 300 Ma groups of detrital zircons also suggests that the northern and southern marginal regions of the E-NCC underwent almost simultaneous late Carboniferous tectonic uplift and denudation, a tectonic change that led to the formation of the sedimentary basins within the E-NCC. Late Carboniferous phyllosilicate layers within the profile are likely to be the equivalent of economically important diaspore and clay dominated bauxites within the E-NCC, suggesting that the diaspore in these bauxites was derived from mica group minerals by resolution-precipitation processes.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Central Andaman Basin (CAB) is generally accepted to be a site of continuous sea floor spreading since the Early Pliocene (similar to 4.0 Ma). The adjacent Alcock and Sewell Rises, and part of the East Andaman basin have been interpreted as probable Miocene oceanic crust. Published seismic lines across the eastern half of the spreading centre show that 100's m thickness of sediment are present right up to the central trough. The central trough margins are faulted, uplifted and tilted away from the central trough. The youngest sediment is ponded and onlaps the tilted central trough margin, while older faulted sediment lies within the trough. Such a configuration is incompatible with continuous spreading. Instead, either spreading in the central basin was episodic, probably comprising a Late Miocene-Early Pliocene phase of spreading, followed by extension accommodated in the Alcock and Sewell rise area (by faulting and dike intrusion), and then a recent (Quaternary) return to spreading in the central trough; or the central trough marks an incipient spreading centre in hyper-thinned continental (or possibly island arc) crust. To resolve these possibilities regional satellite gravity data was inverted to determine crustal type and thickness. The results indicate the CAB is oceanic crust, however the adjacent regions of the Alcock and Sewell Rises and the East Andaman Basin are extended continental crust. These regions were able to undergo extension before seafloor spreading, and when seafloor spreading ceased. Unpublished seismic reflection data across the East Andaman Basin supports the presence of continental crust under the basin that thins drastically westwards towards the spreading centre. Episodic seafloor spreading fits with GPS data onshore that indicate the differential motion of India with respect to SE Asia is accommodated on widely distributed structures that lie between the trench and the Sagaing Fault.

Whereas exploration for conventional reservoirs has been relatively easy, with expressions of resource found close to or even at the surface, exploration for non-conventional systems relies on temperature inherently increasing with depth and searching for favourable geological environments that maximise this increase. To utilitise the information we do have, we often assimilate available exploration data with models that capture the physics of the dominant underlying processes. Here, we discuss computational modelling approaches to exploration at a regional or crust scale, with application to geothermal reservoirs within basins or systems of basins. Target reservoirs have (at least) appropriate temperature, permeability and are at accessible depths. We discuss the software development approach that leads to effective use of the tool Underworld. We explore its role in the process of modelling, understanding computational error, importing and exporting geological knowledge as applied to the geological system underpinning the Guangdong Province, China.</td>

Some of the recorded sequence boundaries (e.g., Cenomanian/Turonian, Turonian/Coniacian, intra Santonian, and Campanian/Maastrichtian sequence boundaries) are not yet confirmed to eustatic sea-level changes. Fourteen main mixed carbonate/siliciclastic facies associations were recognized on a lateral transition between inner to outer ramp settings, with apparent subsidence towards the south. The tectonic position of the Galala Plateaux played an important role in the profound complexity of fades changes and the configuration of depositional sequences representing variable time gaps.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Lake Ohrid, located on the Balkan Peninsula within the Dinaride-Albanide-Hellenide mountain belt, is a tectonically active graben within the South Balkan Extensional Regime (SBER). Interpretation of multichannel seismic cross sections and bathymetric data reveals that Lake Ohrid formed during two main phases of deformation: (1) a transtensional phase which opened a pull-apart basin, and (2) an extensional phase which led to the present geometry of Lake Ohrid. After the initial opening, a symmetrical graben formed during the Late Miocene, bounded by major normal faults on each side in a pull-apart type basin. The early-stage geometry of the basin has a typical rhomboidal shape restricted by two sets of major normal faults. Thick undisturbed sediments are present today at the site where the acoustic basement is deepest, illustrating that Lake Ohrid is a potential target for drilling a long and continuous sediment core for studying environmental changes within the Mediterranean region. Neotectonic activity since the Pliocene takes place along the roughly N-S-striking Eastern and Western Major Boundary Normal Faults that are partly exposed at the present lake floor. The tectono-sedimentary structure of the basin is divided into three main seismic units overlying the acoustic basement associated with fluvial deposits and lacustrine sediments. A seismic facies analysis reveals a prominent cyclic pattern of high- and low-amplitude reflectors. We correlate this facies cyclicity with vegetation changes within the surrounding area that are associated with glacial/interglacial cycles. A clear correlation is possible back to ca. 450kyrs. Extrapolation of average sedimentation rates for the above mentioned period results in age estimate of ca. 2Myrs for the oldest sediments in Lake Ohrid.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Podiform chromitites are common within the mantle section of the Late Cretaceous Sabzevar ophiolite in NE Iran. We studied chromitite pods and related ultramafic rocks from three Sabzevar massifs: Baghjar-Kuh Siah, Gaft Chromitite Mine and Forumad peridotite-chromitite. These represent an upper mantle sequence just below the Sabzevar Moho. The Baghjar-Kuh Siah mantle sequence contains plagioclase Iherzolites, enriched in bulk REEs, with low Cr# spinels and MORB-like clinopyroxenes. These lherzolites formed due to the impregnation of MORB-like melts. The Gaft and Forumad harzburgites are depleted in trace and rare earth elements and thus are residues after high degree of partial melting (more than exhaustion of Cpx). The Galt Chromitite Mine includes two types of podiform chromitites, high Cr# and low Cr#. The melt precipitating high Cr# spinel was boninitic whereas the melt forming the low Cr# chromitites was tholeiitic. Most Forumad massif chromitites have high Cr# spinels, although those rich in silicate inclusions are aluminous. Trace and REE element patterns of Forumad harzburgite clinopyroxene are similar to those in supra-subduction zone (SSZ) peridotites while those of Baghjar-Kuh Siah lherzolites are similar to MOR peridotite clinopyroxenes. These mineral data are also consistent with bulk rock trace and rare earth elements composition of their host peridotites. Field observations indicate that early tholeiitic magmas were followed by late boninites, as revealed in chromitite compositions as well as mantle rocks and dikes. We suggest a time-integrated model for the evolution of the Sabzevar mantle sequence during an early stage of subduction initiation associated with formation of an incipient arc. In this scenario, MORB-like melts (forearc basalts) formed first, causing low Cr# chromitites and plagioclase-clinopyroxene impregnations. Subsequent arc-like or boninitic melts with increasing contribution of slab-derived fluids were responsible for the formation of replacive dunites and high Cr# chromitites.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>We present new whole-rock major and trace element, Re-Os isotope and mineral chemistry data for the upper mantle peridotites and mafic rocks in the Rehafiye ophiolite in NE Anatolia (Turkey), and discuss their significance for the mantle evolution in Neotethys. The Refahiye peridotites include clinopyroxene (cpx)-rich and cpx-poor harzburgites. Assuming an initial fertile mantle composition, the cpx-rich harzburgites have a limited range of Cr-spl Cr# (33-38), implying 14-18% melt extraction. However, TiO2 contents of the Cr-spl in these rocks are too high (up to 0.24 wt.%) to explain their Ti concentrations with a simple melt extraction model in a mid-ocean ridge (MOR) setting, and suggest re-crystallization from an impregnating fertile melt. The interstitial phases of cpx in these samples have high TiO2 (up to 0.40 wt.%) and Na2O (up to 025 wt.%) contents. They also contain interstitial pargasitic amphibole with TiO2 contents varying between 0.69 and 0.88 wt.%. These textures and the mineral chemistry data indicate refertilization of the previously depleted, MOR-type peridotites by percolating hydrous melts. The whole-rock REE partial melting modeling is consistent with slightly lower degrees of mantle melting (similar to 12-14%) compared to the melt extraction degrees obtained from the Cr-spl compositions (similar to 15%). Chromian spinet (Cr-spl) phases in the cpx-poor harzburgites show a wider variation of Cr#, ranging between 57 and 75, and reflect 30-40% of partial melting. In contrast, the whole-rock geochemistry of these rocks represents slightly lower degrees of partial melting, varying between 30 and 35%. The enrichment of TiO2 contents of the Cr-spl (up to 020 wt.%) in some of the cpx-poor harzburgites can be explained by their interaction with Ti-rich hydrous melt formed at supra-subduction (SSZ) tectonic setting. Highly unradiogenic Os isotope composition (0.11956) of a cpx-poor harzburgite sample suggests an ancient melt depletion event experienced by these rocks, whereas its high Re content is a manifestation of subduction enrichment. The mafic units of the Refahiye ophiolite show MORB-like to island arc tholeiite (IAT) geochemical signatures typical of SSZ oceanic crust. A U-Pb zircon age of 183 +/- 1 Ma obtained from an isotropic gabbro sample suggests that the crystallization of the SSZ-type mafic units in the Refahiye ophiolite is as old as the early Jurassic.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>We report on the structure, geochemistry, Re-Os isotopes and relative abundances of highly siderophile elements (HSEs) of the Paleozoic peridotite-basalt occurrences in the Eastern Pontide belt of northeastern Turkey. These peridotites and the associated basaltic rocks are the remnants of the Rheic oceanic lithosphere, incorporated into the Eurasian continental margin during the Variscan (Hercynian) orogeny. The peridotites display a complex record of multiple magmatic, metasomatic and metamorphic events in different tectonic settings during the evolution of the Rheic upper mantle. The Beycam harzburgite (BH) contains low Al2O3 (0.51-1.88 anhydrous wt.%) and high MgO (4135-4234 wt.%) contents, and its bulk-rock trace element compositions are less than 10% of the primitive upper mantle (PUM) values. The platinum, Pd and Re contents of the Beycam harzburgite are highly depleted, whereas its Os, It, and Ru contents are slightly enriched relative to the PUM values. Its Pd and Re contents that are higher than those of the fertile Pulur Iherzolite (PL) to the south and the absence of an isochronous relationship between its Os-187/Os-188 and Re-187/Os-188 show that the trace element distribution and the isotope ratios of the Beycam harzburgite were significantly modified after the first melt-extraction episode. The first melt extraction occurred beneath the Rheic mid-ocean ridge spreading center, whereas the second melt extraction occurred in a mantle wedge above a Rheic subduction zone. The primary magmatic phases of the Pulur lherzolite show the geochemical characteristics typical for fertile lherzolite, formed in the early stages of oceanic lithosphere generation subsequent to the continental break up. The Pulur Iherzolite also contains a secondary magmatic phase in the form of networks of dinopyroxene veins and channels, which are interpreted as an evidence for solid state melt-rock reactions between the Iherzolite and a percolating basaltic melt above a subduction zone. This dinopyroxene addition resulted in the formation of variable concentrations of Al2O3 (2.47-433 wt.%) and MgO (29.76-40.10 wt.%) in the lherzolite. The rhenium, Pd and Pt concentrations of the Pulur lherzolite are depleted relative to the PUM values, whereas the Os, Ir and Ru concentrations are in the range of the PUM values as commonly observed in peridotites with a melt depletion history. The high suprachondritic Os-187/Os-188 is however, inconsistent with a simple melt depletion history, and can be explained by the addition of radiogenic Os-bearing sulfide phases into the lherzolite as a result of melt-rock reactions. Basaltic rocks with an island arc tholeiitic composition from the Beycam area represent the partial melting product of the moderately depleted Beycam harzburgite and the basaltic parental melt from which the dinopyroxene precipitated. The covariation between the Re-187/Os-188 and Os-187/Os-188 of these basaltic rocks defines an isochron age of 377 +/- 8 Ma (late Devonian). The combined structural, geochemical and isotope data indicate a prolonged history of multiple episodes of melt extraction-depletion, and melt-rock interaction and fertilization of the mantle lithosphere of the Rheic Ocean.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Xiadong ultramafic complex, Eastern Xinjiang, NW China, was tectonically emplaced in Proterozoic rocks of the Middle Tianshan Terrane in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt It consists of harzburgite, dunite and websterite and is associated with amphibolite. The amphibolite is interpreted as metamorphosed oceanic crust, and contains igneous zircon grains with an age of 368 +/- 3 Ma.
   <br>All of the ultramafic rocks have highly variable PGE contents. Both the harzburgite and dunite have high PGEs but low Cu and Ni, whereas the dunite and websterite show significant depletion of Ir and Pt. The dunite and harzburgite generally have low Re-187/Os-188 ratios (0.074-0.81) with relatively uniform Os-187/Os-188 ratios from 0.1320 to 0.1375, slightly higher than the primitive upper mantle (PUM) value (0.1296), except for one harzburgite sample with much higher Re-187/Os-188 (24.6) and Os-187/Os-188 ratios (0.4581). The websterite has significantly high Re-187/Os-188 (202-1661) and radiogenic Os-187/Os-188 us (1.166-19.90) ratios relative to the dunite and harzburgite.
   <br>PGE patterns and Re-Os isotopic compositions clearly indicate that the Xiadong complex is a part of an ophiolitic mantle sequence, and the PGE geochemistry suggests a relatively reduced mantle source. Rocks from the complex may have undergone two stages of formation; early partial melting at a mid-ocean ridge generated a depleted mantle sequence with low Re/Os ratios. The harzburgite represents the residuum after partial melting of the lherzolite, whereas the dunite was formed by later melt/rock interaction. The websterites are cumulates derived from SSZ magmas above an intra-oceanic subduction zone during the second stage of formation. This second stage of magmatism resulted in metasomatism and enrichment of Re/Os ratios and Os-187/Os-188 isotope ratios of the mantle rocks. Our new data suggest that the Xiadong complex records the former presence of a major ocean basin between the Tarim Block and the Middle Tianshan Terrane at similar to 368 Ma. The ophiolite was emplaced shortly after the second stage of magmatism. (C) 2014 International Association for Gondwana Research. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In the Thrace region of NE Greece, the crystallization and post-solidification cooling below 600 degrees C of the intrusive suite of the Circum-Rhodope Belt arc-related Evros ophiolite span from 176.4 +/- 0.93 to 163.5 +/- 3.85 Ma. In the underlying Rhodope high-grade metamorphic basement, (ultra-) high-pressure metamafic rocks are cross-cut by orthogneisses with granitoid protoliths and crystallization ages between 160 +/- 0.69 and 154 +/- 1.5 Ma. This new U-Pb LA-ICP-MS zircon geochronological data provides evidence that the timing of the evolution of the Evros ophiolite coincides, within analytical error, with granitoid magmatism in the underlying high-grade basement. One of the dated metagranitoid rocks cross-cuts amphibolitized eclogite, indicating that the highpressure conditions have a maximum age of 160 Ma postdating one of the proposed ages of ultra-high pressure conditions in the Rhodope Massif. The currently earliest recognised Rhodope high/ultra-high pressure metamorphic event is therefore related to the subduction setting which formed the Evros ophiolite. Based on these new temporal constraints and the regional tectonic-geochronologic framework, we discuss and update the geodynamic context connected to the Jurassic subduction-collisional setting at the Rhodope continental margin of Eurasia.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Early Permian strata of the Hongliuhe Formation are located in the Beishan orogenic collage, a tectonically significant region between the Tianshan orogen and the Southern Mongolian accretionary system, of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (also called the Altaids). Stratigraphic reconstruction of the formation shows a general fining upwards sequence of rhythmically interbedded sandstones and siltstones with thick basal successions of conglomerates, all unconformably overlying an earlier mid-Paleozoic volcanic assemblage. The clast lithotypes of conglomerates successively change from being polymictic metamorphic tectonites at the base to a nearly monomictic granitoids mid-section, illustrating the unroofing sequence of an arc-related provenance. The intra-oceanic Gongpoquan composite arc that comprises most of the central Beishan fits the clast-lithotype profile of the conglomerates, and is the most probable provenance. The Hongliuhe Formation stratigraphy experienced a thin-skinned fold-and-thrust belt style of deformation that has a consistent southward vergence. Deformation in the lower stratigraphic levels created thrust imbrication of formation-scale blocks, each separated by steep, north-over-south brittle-ductile shear zones. The blocks are internally deformed with large-scale folding, with one significant block containing a sheath fold 15 km in breadth. The upper stratigraphic levels accommodated strain through low-angle thrust ramping, shear folding, imbricate fanning and duplexing. This indicates that the Hongliuhe Formation was syn-orogenically deposited in a progressively deepening terrestrial- to nearshore environment within the Gongpoquan composite arc. Our observations and data indicate that the basin overlies an earlier Paleozoic suture zone. This implies that the northern half of the Gongpoquan composite arc overrode the southern half in a fault system reactivation centered about this zone of weakness, and created a stratigraphic and structural response consistent with a subduction- or collision-driven fold-andthrust belt. Its southward structural vergence is supporting evidence of a north-dipping subduction-related fault system under the northern Gongpoquan. The timing of both the genesis of the Hongliuhe Formation and this deformation event coincides with the subduction of the Liuyuan Ocean or docking of the Dunhuang block further south, at the southern margin of the Gongpoquan composite arc.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>To better understand the tectonic evolution of West Junggar in the western Altaids, we have conducted a combined paleomagnetic and geochronological study on Late Devonian (D-3), Late Carboniferous (C-2) and Early Permian (P-1) successions from the Tacheng Basin, northwest of China. Both primary and secondary characteristic remanent magnetization components have been successfully isolated and yield three reliable paleomagnetic poles of C-2 and Late Permian (P-2) ages. The C-2 and P-2 poles reveal a significant clockwise rotation of 35.6 degrees +/- 10.4 degrees which is comparable to the rotation deduced in the western part of the Chingiz Range during the time interval C-2 to P-2. Similar rotation patterns for the two units suggest that the Chingiz-West Junggar has remained as a quasi-rigid block by the Py time and constituted the northeast limb of the Kazakhstan Orodine. The differential rotation of ca. 25 degrees to 30 degrees deduced between the northeast and middle limbs of the Kazakhstan Orocline further suggests that at least a part of the curvature of the Balkhash Arc was acquired during the C-2 to P-2 interval and was a continuation of the middle Paleozoic oroclinal bending. Moreover, the C-2 poles for West Junggar and the Junggar Block are significantly different while the P-2 ones almost overlap supporting the view that final closure of the Balkhash-Junggar Ocean occurred during the C-2 to P-2 interval. On the other hand, a large-scale counterclockwise rotation of ca. 80 degrees to 90 degrees is observed in West Junggar and Junggar relative to the western part of the Chingiz Range since the Py time, and this rotation probably represents an important intracontinental deformation within the western part of the Altaids. A reconstruction of the Paleo-Asian Ocean has been proposed in which the Kazakhstan Orocline was emphasized by using the paleomagnetic results and geological evidence.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Three important lithologies occur in two drill wells from the Pan-African basement underlying the Mesozoic Sab'atayn Basin, in a previously undocumented area of the Pan-African, 83 and 90 km NE of known exposures in Yemen. Cores from well 1 include amphibolite, with basaltic to andesitic compositions, affected by crustal contamination during emplacement into a thickened crust. Deeper in the well, an unfoliated dark red monzogranite has a U-Pb zircon age of 628.8 +/- 3.1 Ma and a Rb-Sr biotite cooling age of 591.6 +/- 5.8 Ma (similar to 300 degrees C). Regional constraints suggest emplacement in a transitional tectonic setting with compressional terrane amalgamation followed by extensional collapse. Sm-Nd isotope analysis yields a T-DM model age of 1.24 Ga with negative epsilon(Nd) values, suggesting the monzogranite is part of the Al Bayda island arc terrane. Cores from well 2 contains a weakly deformed, massive (unbedded) medium grey meta-arkose exhibiting essentially no geochemical signature of weathering and with an almost pure dacitic composition. This rock may have been directly derived from an (extrusive) granitoid that was emplaced prior to, or during terrane amalgamation. A (U-Th-Sm)/He zircon age of 156 +/- 14 Ma constrains the time of basement cooling to similar to 180 degrees C, synchronous with basin formation. These lithologies provide new insights in the development of the Pan-African basement of Yemen, extending our knowledge of the nearby surface geology to the subsurface. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Based on isostasy, this paper elegantly explains the differential modern elevations of the large-scale cratonic basins around the Tibetan Plateau. The Qaidam and Tarim basins are endorheic regions with thick Cenozoic deposits, and they uplifted dramatically during the Cenozoic. In contrast, the Sichuan basin is exorheic and most Cenozoic sediments flowed out of the basin; no visible Cenozoic uplift is observed. We suggest that whether a basin is endorheic or exorheic significantly influences its modern elevation, illustrating how exogenic geological processes impact endogenic geological processes. In addition, a new method of estimating paleoelevation is proposed, which predicts successively accelerating uplift of the Qaidam basin during the Cenozoic and provides good constraints on the geological evolution of the northern Tibetan Plateau.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>At present, advanced numerical models of pipelines crossing active faults are based on the representation of the pipeline as an ensemble of shell or solid finite elements. The surrounding soil is represented as an inelastic continuum using appropriate constitutive models and three-dimensional (3D) solid elements. The pipeline-soil interaction is modeled as a surface-to-surface contact problem. These models allow a detailed analysis of the stress-strain state with account for localized limit states to be performed. Still, concerning the lack of data from real seismic events and large-scale tests, which can be used for calibration of numerical models, the question of adequacy of the numerical results is a topical issue. In this paper, a 3D numerical model of a buried steel pipeline crossing an active tectonic fault is developed and discussed with an emphasis on the pipeline-soil interaction and mathematical representation of the fault. The influence of the fault model on the predicted stress-strain state of the pipeline is analyzed using two different types of fault representation. The first approach is based on the continuous representation of the fault; in the second approach, two separate soil blocks interacting along the fault plane are introduced. The latter approach has not yet been applied to the analysis of fault-crossing problems. The numerical results are compared on the basis of displacement, strain and contact soil pressure distributions, evolution of the pipe ovalization parameter and bending moment in the critical cross section, and soil deformations in the near-fault zone.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Villanovan (and eventually Etruscan) sites show a close spatial association with young ultra-potassic volcanic rocks in both southern Etruria and Campania, a discrete cultural distribution that closely resembles the discrete occurrences of those unusual rocks. This association is probably due to the soil fertility that results from their weathering. In Etruria most sites line up along the margin of the volcanic terrane, which brought additional advantages for construction, defense, and resources. Trade for Elban iron ores with Campanian Greek colonies was also a factor enriching coast-facing sites. In Campania most Villanovan sites line up along the margins of coastal plains that had been fertilized by ultra-potassic volcanic ash falls. All three geologic features (the two volcanic areas and the iron deposits) are thought to have formed in the same tectonic environment, above a subduction zone where colliding tectonic plates melt at depth. Geologic factors apparently created environmental opportunities that each cultural entity in ancient Italy exploited differently. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Capo S. Marco is the southernmost termination of the Sinis Peninsula in the northwestern border of the Oristano Gulf (western Sardinia, Italy). In the area, there are some of the most controversial and debated Quaternary deposits of Sardinia, consisting of beach, aeolian and slope sediments, whose chronological attribution changed according to different authors and, in different times, by the same authors. These discrepancies have not been solved by new radiometric dates, as radiocarbon and Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) methods provided ages that are significantly different. During recent investigations at Capo S. Marco, beach notches filled with bioclastic sands, gravels, and boulders were discovered up to an elevation of similar to 4.5 m, which is the highest elevation of the known beach notches. These sediments rest on aeolian deposits and form a marine terrace in two sites. In some places, these sediments also include small colonies of the coral Cladocora caespitosa in living position that have been recently dated by U/Th at 70 +/- 4 ka and attributed to the end of MIS 5. Here, we report new U-series analyses of two samples of C. caespitosa collected on the uppermost part of the sequence. The U/Th ages of 153 +/- 0.8 and 149 +/- 0.6 ka would correspond to MIS 6, but the high values for the initial delta U-234 (177 and 179) compared to the modern seawater value (147) point to an open-system addition of U-234 and/or Th-230. The corrected ages using the open-system model of Thomson et al. are 141.6 +/- 2 and 132 +/- 2 ka. However, these deposits and the beach notches are not buried under aeolian or colluvial sediments, as are almost all the Tyrrhenian marine deposits found in Sardinia. They also rest on aeolian sediments, which, at San Giovanni di Sinis, were dated to MIS4 or Late MIS2 by OSL and radiocarbon dating of buried organic palaeosols, respectively. Accordingly, the stratigraphic evidence would suggest their attribution to the Holocene, although this contrasts with the Holocene sea level models available and the U/Th dating results.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In order to better constrain the relationship between tectonics and sedimentation of the Eastern Sardinian Margin, from the Messinian to the present day (METYSS project), a lithostratigraphic study was carried out on the Late Neogene deposits along the Cedrino Valley (eastern Sardinia). The late Neogene evolution is documented from sedimentological and tectonic analysis, biostratigraphic dating, and by mapping and logging stratigraphic sections. Previous authors have differentiated an early Pliocene marine formation from an older continental formation, possibly Miocene, the entire system being covered by late Pliocene to Quaternary lava flows. Preliminary biostratigraphic data suggest the absence of the lowermost Pliocene, based on the absence of Globorotalia margaritae and the presence of Globorotalia puncticulata, implying a sediment age between 3.81 and 2.41 Ma. At the foot of the Fiuli cliff, some mud clasts include a coccolith microflora, Tortonian in age, suggesting reworking. The Pliocene marine deposits consist of a single filling sequence instead of a succession of superimposed sequences as we would expect during this period of time; the occurrences of terms rarely respect the usual transgressive-regressive succession. Contrasting bathymetric environments (fore-shore, pro-delta, shelf or upper slope) can be abruptly superimposed on top of the other, along few meter thick intervals. A rapidly flooded term is observed in several sites and indicates a spatial variability over only a few kilometers distance. Some deep water deposits are in the middle of the infilling Pliocene sequence, whereas shallower water deposits can be repeated along a vertical section, or even interrupted by emersion. These marked differences can express syn-, or possibly post-sedimentation tectonic uplifts. The 10-25 degrees bed dips originated through local tectonic uplift. At Fiuli, the geometry of the bedding planes is indicative of tilting toward the west, in a direction opposite to the one observed at Onifai. These Pliocene series form a wide syncline with an approximately NNE-SSW axis. This morpho-structural behavior appears to be largely atypical of this East-Sardinian coastal area.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Triassic granites crop out extensively in central Hunan Province, South China. Representative granites include the Baimashan, Weishan, and Ziyunshan plutons. Lithologically, these granites mainly comprise biotite monzogranite, two-mica granites, hornblende-biotite granite, hornblende-biotite monzogranite, and garnet-muscovite granite. These granites have in situ zircon secondary ion mass spectrum U-Pb ages between 223.2 +/- 3.3 and 209.3 +/- 4.0Ma, indicating that they likely formed predominantly in the Late Triassic. These granitic plutons have similar zircon Hf and O isotopic compositions, with epsilon(Hf)(t) values of -0.8 to -9.0, two-stage depleted mantle model ages (T-DM2) of 1.81-1.31Ga, and weighted mean of delta O-18(Zrc) values of 8.53 +/- 0.58 parts per thousand to 9.12 +/- 0.28 parts per thousand. Combined with U-Pb dating and Hf isotopic data, the elevated and variable delta O-18 and epsilon(Hf)(t) values of the individual granites indicate that these Triassic granites were likely produced by partial melting of upper Paleoproterozoic to lower Mesoproterozoic metasedimentary rocks and are S-type granites. The variable proportions of inherited zircons in certain samples with U-Pb ages of 627-992Ma indicate the involvement of lower-middle Neoproterozoic crustal materials during magma crystallization through wall-rock contamination, which resulted in the wide range of isotopic compositions. Underplating of mantle-derived magma may have provided the thermal energy for partial melting of the upper Paleoproterozoic and lower Mesoproterozoic basements, thereby generating these late Triassic granites. The lack of positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values and high delta O-18(Zrc) values indicate that the contribution of mantle-derived magmas to these granites may be insignificant.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Understanding Neoproterozoic crustal evolution is fundamental to reconstructing the Gondwana supercontinent, which was assembled at this time. Here we report evidence of Cryogenian crustal reworking in the Madurai Block of the Southern Granulite Terrane of India. The study focuses on a garnet-bearing granite-charnockite suite, where the granite shows in situ dehydration into patches and veins of incipient charnockite along the contact with charnockite. The granite also carries dismembered layers of Mg-Al-rich granulite. Micro-textural evidence for dehydration of granite in the presence of CO2-rich fluids includes the formation of orthopyroxene by the breakdown of biotite, neoblastic zircon growth in the dehydration zone, at around 870 degrees C and 8kbar. The zircon U-Pb ages suggest formation of the granite, charnockite, and incipient charnockite at 836 +/- 73, 831 +/- 31, and 772 +/- 49Ma, respectively. Negative zircon epsilon Hf (t) (-5 to -20) values suggest that these rocks were derived from a reworked Palaeoproterozoic crustal source. Zircon grains in the Mg-Al-rich granulite record a spectrum of ages from ca. 2300 to ca. 500Ma, suggesting multiple provenances ranging from Palaeoproterozoic to mid-Neoproterozoic, with neoblastic zircon growth during high-temperature metamorphism in the Cambrian. We propose that the garnet-bearing granite and charnockite reflect the crustal reworking of aluminous crustal material indicated by the presence of biotite+quartz+aluminosilicate inclusions in the garnet within the granite. This crustal source can be the Mg-Al-rich layers carried by the granite itself, which later experienced high-temperature regional metamorphism at ca. 550Ma. Our model also envisages that the CO2 which dehydrated the garnet-bearing granite generating incipient charnockite was sourced from the proximal massive charnockite through advection. These Cryogenian crustal reworking events are related to prolonged tectonic activities prior to the final assembly of the Gondwana supercontinent.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Detrital zircon U/Pb ages provide new insights into the provenance of Upper Devonian-Permian clastic rocks of Bel'kovsky Island, within the New Siberian Islands archipelago. Based on these new data, we demonstrate that Upper Devonian-Carboniferous turbidites of Bel'kovsky Island were derived from Grenvillian, Sveconorwegian, and Timanian sources similar to those that fed Devonian-Carboniferous deposits of the Severnaya Zemlya archipelago and Wrangel Island and were probably located within Laurentia-Baltica. Detrital zircon ages from the lower Permian deposits of Bel'kovsky Island suggest a drastic change in provenance and show a strong affinity with the Uralian Orogen. Two possible models to interpret this shift in provenance are proposed. The first involves movement of these continental blocks from the continental margin of Laurentia-Baltica towards the Uralian Orogen during the late Carboniferous to Permian, while the second argues for long sediment transport across the Barents shelf.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Here we present new U-Pb and Hf isotopic data for detrital zircons obtained from six samples of late Palaeozoic units from central Jilin Province, Northeast China, and use these data and sedimentary formations to constrain the late Palaeozoic tectonic evolution of the eastern segment of the southern margin of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt. The majority of the detrital zircons from the six samples are euhedral-subhedral and exhibit oscillatory zoning, indicating a magmatic origin. Zircons from sandstones in the Devonian Wangjiajie and Xiaosuihe formations yield seven main age populations (399, 440, 921, 1648, 1864, 1911, and 2066Ma) and two minor age populations (384 and 432Ma), respectively. Zircons from a quartz sandstone in the Carboniferous Luquantun Formation yield four age populations (~332, 363, 402, and 428Ma), and zircons from quartz sandstones of the Permian Shoushangou, Fanjiatun, and Yangjiagou formations yield age populations of 265, 369, 463, 503, and 963Ma; 264, 310, 337, 486, and 529Ma; and 262, 282, 312, 338, 380, 465, and 492Ma, respectively. These data, together with the ages of magmatic zircons from interbedded volcanics and biostratigraphic evidence, as well as analysis of formations, give rise to the following conclusions. (1) The Wangjiajie and Xiaosuihe formations were deposited in an extensional environment during Middle and Middle-Late Devonian time, respectively. The former was sourced mainly from ancient continental material of the North China Craton with minor contributions from newly accreted crust, while the latter was sourced mainly from newly accreted crust. (2) The Luquantun Formation formed in an extensional environment during early-late Carboniferous time from material sourced mainly from newly accreted crust. (3) The Shoushangou, Fanjiatun, and Yangjiagou formations formed during a period of rapid uplift in the late Permian, from material sourced mainly from newly accreted crust.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Qimantage area of Northwest China lies in the western part of the East Kunlun Orogenic Belt, and is dominated by late Permian to Late Triassic granitoids. Among these, the Middle Triassic granitoids are mainly distributed south of the North Kunlun Fault, and consist of two main granitic assemblages: the Kaimuqi assemblage in the east and the Mositu assemblage in the west. To better constrain the Indosinian tectonic evolution of this area, we present data on the geochronology, geochemistry, and petrology of ore-bearing granodiorites from the Kaimuqi area in eastern Qimantage. The granodiorite samples have porphyritic or fine-grained textures. Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry U-Pb zircon dating yields emplacement ages of 238-242Ma, interpreted here as the result of the Middle Triassic magmatism. The granodiorites are mostly of the high-K calc-alkaline series, and are enriched in light rare earth elements, depleted in heavy rare earth elements such as Nb, Ta, P, and Ti, and have weak negative Eu (Eu/Eu*) anomalies. The Kaimuqi granodiorites have lower SiO2 and Sr contents, and higher Na2O/K2O ratios than the Mositu granodiorites. They also show initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of 0.712151-0.715436, epsilon Nd(t) values of -7.4 to -6.3, and two-stage Nd model ages of 1.53-1.61Ga. Together with their radiogenic Pb isotopic ratios for Pb-206/Pb-204((t)) (18.271-18.622), Pb-207/Pb-204((t)) (15.637-15.651), and Pb-208/Pb-204((t)) (38.452-37.870), these data indicate both mantle and crustal contributions to the source of the granodiorites. Field investigations show that Middle Triassic granitoids in both the Mositu and Kaimuqi assemblages contain large numbers of mafic microgranular enclaves, which supports an interpretation of mantle and crustal magmatic mixing. Based on a comparison of these results with data from coeval granites in the Mositu assemblage, we propose that the Middle Triassic granitoids in the Qimantage area were produced at ca. 240Ma, as a result of the end of subduction and the initiation of collision during the Variscan-Indosinian orogeny. Magma mixing may be interpreted as the result of slab breakoff in a subduction zone environment, which led to fluid metasomatism and induced partial melting of an enriched lithospheric mantle, resulting in the formation of voluminous granitic magma.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The origin and life cycle of ocean islands have been debated since the early days of Geology. In the case of the Canary archipelago, its proximity to the Atlas orogen led to initial fracture-controlled models for island genesis, while later workers cited a Miocene-Quaternary east-west age-progression to support an underlying mantle-plume. The recent discovery of submarine Cretaceous volcanic rocks near the westernmost island of El Hierro now questions this systematic age-progression within the archipelago. If a mantle-plume is indeed responsible for the Canaries, the onshore volcanic age-progression should be complemented by progressively younger pre-island sedimentary strata towards the west, however, direct age constraints for the westernmost pre-island sediments are lacking. Here we report on new age data obtained from calcareous nannofossils in sedimentary xenoliths erupted during the 2011 El Hierro events, which date the sub-island sedimentary rocks to between late Cretaceous and Pliocene in age. This age-range includes substantially younger pre-volcanic sedimentary rocks than the Jurassic to Miocene strata known from the older eastern islands and now reinstate the mantle-plume hypothesis as the most plausible explanation for Canary volcanism. The recently discovered Cretaceous submarine volcanic rocks in the region are, in turn, part of an older, fracture-related tectonic episode.</td>

The U-Pb monazite ages obtained from the augen gneiss (308 +/- 3 Ma), late kinematic Vialais granite (303 +/- 4 Ma), and post-kinematic leucogranite (298 +/- 2 Ma), bracket the high-temperature deformation and metamorphism at similar to 310-300 Ma, clearly postdating regional contraction and nappe emplacement (&gt;320 Ma). The planar-linear and locally linear fabrics in the augen gneiss outline a regional-scale double dome structure (Caroux and Espinouse sub-domes) containing smaller (km-scale) upright folds. Compared to the Caroux sub-dome, the larger, migmatitic Espinouse sub-dome contains abundant leucosome, leucogranite bodies and late-kinematic intrusions (Vialais granite). The Vialais granite displays a weak magmatic foliation that defines the main layering of the Espinouse migmatite. Ellipsoidal quartz-sillimanite nodules concentrated above the roof of the granite recorded an increment of strain (vertical shortening, E-NE elongation) during granite emplacement and crystallization, consistent with the extension event that exhumed the domes. These new geochronological and structural data suggest that the Montagne Noire double dome formed in a pull-apart structure within a dextral strike-slip system. Upright folding in the sub-domes has been traditionally assigned to a regional contraction event; alternatively, we propose that local contraction is associated with the convergence of low-viscosity crust beneath the upper crust pull-apart. Dynamic models of extension of hot crust indicate that contraction at depth is generated by flow of low-viscosity orogenic crust converging and rising to fill the gap created by upper crust extension. This interpretation solves the long-standing problem of apparent coeval contraction and extension in the Montagne Noire double dome and establishes migmatite dome emplacement in strike-slip corridors as a style of late Variscan tectonics.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>A geologic and geodetic integrated analysis of the northern margin of the Hyblean Plateau (SE Sicily) has been carried out in order to test the relationship between the active deformation, recorded by GPS data, and the long-term tectonic evolution, reconstructed by the interpretation of structural and morphological data. Our study revealed the active growth of a large antiform, as a consequence of the positive tectonic inversion of the previous flexure, bordering the Hyblean Foreland. The deformation of Middle-Late Pleistocene marine terraces and the evolution of the drainage system are consistent with a progressive regional tilting of the entire eastern sector of the Hyblean Plateau (Siracusa Domain), representing the southern limb of the active antiform. The geometry of the Late Quaternary marine strandlines, compared with the results of analogue models, is compatible with the effects of the NW-ward propagation of a detachment fault at depth. The active deformation of the Hyblean region, coherent with the Nubia-Eurasia plate convergence, suggests to candidate the inverted tectonics at the northern border of the Hyblean Plateau as potential seismogenic sources of the area.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The growth and decay of oceanic volcanoes developed close to plate boundaries are intrinsically related to a competition between construction and destruction processes, partly controlled by tectonic strain and stresses. From morphologic, stratigraphic, tectonic and new high-precision K-Ar data, we present a comprehensive picture of the volcano-tectonic evolution of Santa Maria, and discuss its significance regarding the stress evolution and regional deformation in the Azores. Our new data show that: (1) the western flat portion of the island is mostly composed of west-dipping volcanic rocks here dated between 5.70 +/- 0.08 and 5.33 +/- 0.08 Ma, which we consider the remnants of an Older Shield Volcano; (2) more than half of this early volcanic complex has been removed by an east-directed large-scale sector collapse; (3) a second volcano, here coined the Younger Shield Volcano, grew rapidly on the collapse scar between at least 4.32 +/- 0.06 and 3.94 +/- 0.06 Ma; (4) more than half of this new volcano was removed by a second large-scale sector collapse most probably around 3.6 Ma, based on the ages of Parasitic Scoria Cones sitting unconformably on the Younger Shield Volcano; (5) the latest parasitic volcanic activity is here dated at 2.84 +/- 0.04 Ma, extending significantly the known eruptive history of Santa Maria. Morpho-structural data (shape of the island, faults, dikes, and distribution of volcanic cones) show a significant control of construction and destruction along the N045 degrees and N150 degrees directions. The age of the lavas intruded by dikes suggests that the N045 degrees and the N150 degrees trends are ca. 53 Ma old and younger than ca. 43 Ma, respectively. Based on the new data, we conclude that a change in the regional stress field occurred between 53 and 4.3 Ma, most likely associated with a major reconfiguration of the Eurasia/Nubia plate boundary in the Azores.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>During the Early-Middle Miocene (Western Anatolia) several volcanic fields occur along a NE-SW-trending shear zone, known as Izmir-Balikesir Transfer Zone. This is a deformed crustal-scale sinistral strike-slip fault zone crossing the Bornova flysch and extending along the NW-boundary of the Menderes Massif by accommodating the differential deformation between the Cycladic and Menderes core complexes within the Aegean extensional system. Here we discuss the volcanic activity in Yamanlar and Yuntdagi fields that is closely related to the extensional tectonics of the Izmir-Balikesir Transfer Zone and in the same time with the episodic core complex denudation of the Menderes Massif.
   <br>This study documents two composite volcanoes (Yamanlar and Yuntdagi), whose present vent area is strongly eroded and cut by a variety of strike-slip and normal fault systems, the transcurrent NW-SE being the dominant one. The erosional remnants of the vent areas, resembling a shallow crater intrusive complex, illustrate the presence of numerous dykes or variably sized neck-like intrusions and lava flows, typically associated with hydrothermal alteration processes (propylitic and argillic). Such vent areas were observed in both the examined volcanic fields, having similar to 6 km in diameter and being much more eroded toward the south, along the NW-SE fault system. Lava flows and lava domes are sometimes associated with proximal block and ash flow deposits. In the cone-building association part, besides lava flows and remnants of lava domes, rare block and ash and pumice-rich pyroclastic flow deposits, as well as a series of debris-flow deposits, have been observed.
   <br>The rocks display a porphyritic texture and contain various proportions of plagioclase, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, amphibole, rare biotite and corroded quartz. The examined rocks fall at the limit between calc-alkaline to alkaline field, and plot predominantly in high-K andesite and dacite fields and one is rhyolite. The trace element distribution suggests fractional crystallization processes and mixing in upper crustal magma chambers and suggests a metasomatized lithospheric mantle/lower crust source. This preliminary volcanological-petrological and geochronological base study allowed documenting the Yamanlar and Yuntdagi as composite volcanoes generated during post-collisional Early-Middle Miocene transtensional tectonic movements.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Here we show for the first time the 3D-structural evolution of an explosive submarine volcano by means of reflection seismic interpretation. Four to five vertically stacked circular and cone-shaped units consisting mainly of volcaniclastics build the Kolumbo underwater volcano which experienced its first eruption &gt; 70 ka ago and its last explosive eruption 1650 AD, 7 km NE of Santorini volcano (southern Aegean Sea). The summed volume of volcaniclastics is estimated to range between 13-22 km(3). The entire Kolumbo volcanic complex has a height of &gt;= 1 km and a diameter of &gt;= 11 km. All volcaniclastic units reveal the same transparent reflection pattern strongly suggesting that explosive underwater volcanism was the prevalent process. Growth faults terminate upwards at the base of volcaniclastic units, thus representing a predictor to an eruption phase. Similarities in seismic reflection pattern between Kolumbo and near-by volcanic cones imply that the smaller cones evolved through explosive eruptions as well. Hence, the central Aegean Sea experienced several more explosive eruptions (&gt;= 23) than previously assumed, thus justifying further risk assessment. However, the eruption columns from the smaller volcanic cones did not reach the air and- consequently - no sub-aerial pyroclastic surge was created. The Anydros basin that hosts Kolumbo volcanic field opened incrementally NW to SE and parallel to the Pliny and Strabo trends during four major tectonic pulses prior to the onset of underwater volcanism.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Palaeoenvironmental reconstructions from across the globe indicate that the climatic and oceanographic changes that accompanied the Permian transition from deep icehouse to greenhouse conditions were uneven and asynchronous. Because of a paucity of well-constrained data, environmental changes in Gondwana remain poorly understood relative to tropical Pangaea. In this regard, the Permian System of eastern Australia provides a unique record of this transition along a high-latitude, open marine shelf. Not only was glaciation protracted here relative to other regions of Gondwana, but the record also spans temperate to polar palaeolatitudes, providing an opportunity to examine environmental changes along a latitudinal transect. We integrate proxies for delta O-18(seawater) palaeotemperature, pCO(2), and depositional environment to assess the evolution of nearshore conditions through the Permian. Glaciation was not continuous, but rather focused into four discrete, glacial epochs (P1-P4), each several million years in length, which alternated with nonglacial intervals of similar duration. During the Asselian-mid-Artinskian (P1-P2 time), uniform conditions along the full extent of the margin were maintained by a cold boundary current coupled with oceanic upwelling. Increased spatiotemporal variability is evident at the end of glacial P2 (mid-Artinskian), perhaps due to tectonic changes that impacted the palaeogeography of the margin. Although glaciers had disappeared by this time elsewhere in Gondwana, eastern Australia saw two additional periods of glaciation, P3 (Roadian-earliest Captianian) and P4 (early Wuchiagingian). Continued, albeit intermittent, glaciation was facilitated by drift toward higher palaeolatitudes, orogenic activity that led to the development of areas of high elevation that could serve as nucleation points for glaciers, and transient drops in atmospheric pCO(2). Variations in meltwater input exerted a strong effect on local delta O-18(seawater) values, complicating attempts to reconstruct latitudinal gradients in palaeotemperature.. Results point to atmospheric CO2 as the primary driver responsible for the dynamic climate variations evident in the record. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Using P-wave refraction data from the L-SCAN controlled-source seismic experiment, the three-dimensional anisotropy structure of the upper crust is determined along the Eastern Lau Spreading Center (ELSC). The tomographic image of anisotropy magnitude and orientation is constructed from similar to 197000 travel time measurements of P-wave arrivals recorded on 83 ocean bottom seismometers, providing the most detailed and extensive view of upper-crustal spreading center anisotropy to date. P-wave speeds vary with the azimuth of the seismic ray path, a type of anisotropy produced by stress-aligned lithospheric cracks and microcracks. Across the study area, the fast axes of anisotropy are generally oriented parallel to the trend of the spreading center, as expected for ridge-parallel cracks that form in association with seafloor spreading. The seismic study encompassed four individual spreading segments of the ELSC separated by three overlapping spreading centers (OSC). The two larger OSCs exhibit high anisotropy that penetrates deep into the upper crust. Surrounding these OSCs, and in the wake of the largest, are regions where the fast axes of anisotropy are misaligned relative to the general trend. In these areas, the observations agree with numerical models and seafloor morphology that suggest tensile stress concentrations and a high degree of brittle crack formation. The tomographic images indicate that the location and dynamics of persistent ridge offsets can be tracked back through time via their anomalous anisotropy. Along the spreading centers, and away from ridge tips, the anisotropy is greater where the melt supply is inferred to be greater, and smaller where the melt supply is inferred to be smaller. This is opposite to the trend expected if simple tectonic stress models govern anisotropy. Alternatively, hydrothermal activity is expected to increase with magma supply and can explain higher anisotropy via hydrofracturing. This study provides the first evidence that seismic anisotropy tracks variations in hydrologic activity along the crests of oceanic spreading centers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Montecchio cave (Grosseto province, Tuscany, Italy) opens at 320 m asl, in a small outcrop of Jurassic limestone (Calcare Massiccio Fm.), close to the Albegna river. This area is characterised by the presence of several thermal springs and the outcropping of travertine deposits at different altitudes. The Montecchio cave, with passage length development of over 1700 m, is characterised by the presence of several sub-horizontal passages and many medium- and small-scale morphologies indicative of sulphuric acid speleogenesis (SAS). The thermal aquifer is intercepted at a depth of about 100 m below the entrance: the water temperature exceeds 30 degrees C and sulphate content is over 1300 mg l(-1). The cave hosts large gypsum deposits from 40 to 100 m below the entrance that are by-products of the reaction between sulphuric acid and the carbonate host rock. The lower part of the cave hosts over 1 m thick calcite cave raft deposits, which are evidence of long-standing, probably thermal, water in an evaporative environment related to significant air currents.
   <br>Sulphur isotopes of gypsum have negative delta S-34 values (from -28.3 to -24.2 parts per thousand), typical of SAS. Calcite cave rafts and speleogenetic gypsum both yield young U/Th ages varying from 68.5 ka to 2 ka BP, indicating a rapid phase of dewatering followed by gypsum precipitation in aerate environment. This fast water table lowering is related to a rapid incision of the nearby Albegna river, and was followed by a 20-30 m fluctuation of the thermal water table, as recorded in the calcite raft deposits and gypsum crusts.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>We investigate the origins of Triton's deformed and young surface. Assuming Triton was captured early in Solar System history, the bulk of the energy released during capture will have been lost, and cannot be responsible for its present-day activity. Radiogenic heating is sufficient to maintain a long-lived ocean beneath a conductive ice shell, but insufficient to cause convective deformation and yielding at the surface. However, Triton's high inclination likely causes a significant (approximate to 0.7 degrees) obliquity, resulting in large heat fluxes due to tidal dissipation in any subsurface ocean. For a 300 km thick ice shell, the estimated ocean heat production rate (approximate to 0.3 TW) is capable of producing surface yielding and mobile-lid convection. Requiring convection places an upper bound on the ice shell viscosity, while the requirement for yielding imposes a lower bound. Both bounds can be satisfied with an ocean temperature approximate to 240 K for our nominal temperature-viscosity relationship, suggesting the presence of an antifreeze such as NH3. In our view, Triton's geological activity is driven by obliquity tides, which arise because of its inclination. In contrast, Pluto is unlikely to be experiencing significant tidal heating. While Pluto may have experienced ancient tectonic deformation, we do not anticipate seeing the kind of young, deformed surfaces seen at Triton. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Pluto-Charon system, likely formed from an impact, has reached the endpoint of its tidal evolution. During its evolution into the dual-synchronous state, the equilibrium tidal figures of Pluto and Charon would have also evolved as angular momentum was transferred from Pluto's spin to Charon's orbit. The rate of tidal evolution is controlled by Pluto's interior physical and thermal state. We examine three interior models for Pluto: an undifferentiated rock/ice mixture, differentiated with ice above rock, and differentiated with an ocean. For the undifferentiated case without an ocean, the Pluto-Charon binary does not evolve to its current state unless its internal temperature T-t &gt; 200 K, which would likely lead to strong tidal heating, melting, and differentiation. Without an ocean, Pluto's interior temperature must be higher than 240 K for Charon to evolve on a time scale less than the age of the Solar System. Further tidal heating would likely create an ocean. If New Horizons finds evidence of ancient tidally-driven tectonic activity on either body, the most likely explanation is that Pluto had an internal ocean during Charon's orbital evolution.

The analysis of surface data, including a digital elevation model (DEM), and Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images, was combined with airborne magnetic data to better understand three-dimensional geology in the area. The ETM+ and DEM data were used to map geological structures at the surface, which indicate that the area consists of two main fault systems that trend NNE and E-W. The two trends represent the remnants of reactivated structures that formed under the stress regimes generated during the tectonic evolution of eastern Afghanistan. Magnetic data indicate an NE-SW trending basin. A two-dimensional schematic model shows that the basin gradually deepens toward the SW with depths to the magnetic basement ranging between 2 and 11.5 km. The integration of the results gave new insight into the tectonic evolution and structure patterns near the pegmatites area. (C) 2015 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>We investigate the drilling mud gas from 70 m to 1200 m borehole depth of the Wenchuan earthquake Fault Scientific Drilling Hole-1 (WFSD-1) in the context of rapid response fault zone drilling to large earthquakes. Complete depth profiles are accomplished for CH4, He, Hz, CO2, N-2, Ar, O-2 and N-2/Ar. Rn-222 is also available for a limited depth. The volcanic hanging wall generates high Rn and He, whereas the CH4 is low. The sedimentary footwall yields higher CH4 and CO2, with CH4 peaks up to 2.5 vol.% in the intensely fractured shale and siltstone from 640 m to 715 m.
   <br>The drilling mud gases distribute asymmetrically across the co-seismic slip plane at 589.2 m, with the bellow 117 m true depth manifests as a prominent gas anomaly zone. Gas concentrations in this zone are much higher and vary more violently than the upper 200 m. The low P-wave velocity and resistivity imply that the strata are highly fractured, and gases intruded the borehole mainly by dissolving in water. We suggest that the gas distributions are partially lithology affected, but mostly fracture constrained according to the lithology variations, subsidiary fault zone and fracture distribution retrieved from the core. Considering the low deformation rate and seismicity in this region before the earthquake, together with the ductile behavior of the clay-rich fault gouge under slow tectonic loading, and the decreasing gas anomalies away from the slipping plane, we propose that the fractures were mostly generated during the Wenchuan earthquake. It indicates that the Wenchuan earthquake damaged the footwall more than the hanging wall, and the 117 m depth marks the width of the fracturing zone. The differential mechanic property between the hanging wall and the footwall, and the asymmetric stress during the rupturing may contribute to the asymmetric fracture distribution.

Study areas are the Parana Basin (Brazil), Karoo Basin and Cape Fold Belt (South Africa), the Arabian Platform, Scythian and Turan platforms (Central Asia) and eastern Australia. The form of the tectonic subsidence curves derived from backstripping analysis is consistent with results from a forward model, which produces thermal subsidence of crust with normal thickness (similar to 35 km) but low initial mantle lithosphere thickness. This high thickness ratio of crust: mantle lithosphere is the plausible initial configuration of lithosphere produced by accretionary tectonics. Our results do not require late stage orogenic extension or lithosphere delamination as a precursor to the thermal subsidence phase. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Fault zones have the capacity to be hydraulic conduits within upper crustal levels, allowing migration of large volume of fluids through shallow and deeper geological environments. Low-angle normal faults (LANFs) crosscutting carbonate rocks produce damaged volumes that may have a relevant role in channelling or hosting geothermal fluids, therefore deserving of investigation to better predict mining targets. Deformation along LANFs zones, dissecting carbonate successions, produces permeable volumes presently exploited in the Larderello and Monte Amiata geothermal areas (Italy). In this paper, the architectural and permeability features of an exhumed LANF-zone exposed in the Northern Apennines, (Rapolano Terme, central Italy), affecting Cretaceous bedded limestone, are presented. Such a fault was not affected by circulation of geothermal fluids, but its features could reveal much on the potential impact on fluids migration in the active geothermal areas, therefore resulting an intriguing analogue. The study LANF-zone consists of faults, which enucleated at depth &gt;4 km. During its earlier stage of evolution, dissolution seams, often arranged in s-c fabric, characterised the whole damage zone. Dissolution seams developed under very low-grade metamorphism (T = 100-150 degrees C) as indicated by illite crystallinty analyses. Fault zone architecture and permeability features changed during the fault growth and exhumation. Permeability heterogeneity and anisotropy characterised the LANF zone during its development. If geofluids circulated within the fault zone, it could be an effective barrier during its earlier evolution, being accompanied by dissolution seams. On the contrary, it could play as combined barriers-conduits during its later evolution (progressively at shallower levels) being characterised by intersecting fault planes, which define pipe-like conduits parallel to the direction of the tectonic transport. Such a configuration could have the capacity to impact on fluids migration for long paths across the upper crustal levels. This adds significant information for predicting deeper geothermal circuits and the location of potential exploitable reservoirs in active tectonic environments. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The South Korea Plateau is a remnant of continental crust in the middle of the eastern Korean margin that was deformed by extension in association with back-arc rifting and separation of the southwestern Japan Arc in the Cenozoic. Multichannel seismic profiles show that the South Korea Plateau preserves structure of rift basins flanked by uplifted footwall blocks. Rift basins in the plateau are filled with distinct syn- and post-rift sequences separated by a prominent breakup unconformity resulting from uplift. The crustal and upper mantle structures computed by ambient noise tomography indicate that the South Korea Plateau defines the seaward limit of rifted continental crust; in addition, rifting occurred with vigorous asthenospheric upwelling induced along the Korean margin and depth-dependent stretching. Therefore, the South Korea Plateau underwent the entire sequence of tectonic events typical of a passive continental margin encompassing rifting with subsidence, uplift, erosion, and breakup prior to the separation of the southwestern Japan Arc. Breakup at the Korean margin may substantiate successive episodes of back-arc spreading which migrated toward the arc in response to trench retreat. We suggest that the southwestern Japan Arc moved to its present location from the southern part of the Korean margin with a significant amount of clockwise rotation during back-arc spreading.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Evolution of the east-west-trending Gokova Graben structure is related to the north-south extension of the Aegean segment of the Aegean-Anatolian Microplate. The Pliocene-Quaternary successions surrounding the onland portion of the Gokova Graben as well as coeval successions within the marine portion of the graben are cut by at least three families of faults that strike northwest-southeast, east-west and east-northeast-west-southwest. These orientations are inconsistent with a simple north-south extensional regime. Interpretation of seismic reflection profiles, multibeam bathymetty and GPS vectors indicates that the Gokova Graben developed as a lazy-S-shaped graben in the back-arc setting north of the Hellenic Arc. A counterclockwise rotation of the Aegean segment of the Aegean-Anatolian Microplate is the suggested mechanism for this geometry, as subduction zone rolled back occurred during the Pliocene-Quaternary. The Gulf of Gokova is the youngest of a series of basins that developed within this large back-arc system, including the Nisyros, Karpathos, and Kamilonisi basins, collectively named to as the Gokova-Nisyros-Karpathos Graben. It is proposed that this graben experienced a scissor-like opening initiating from the west during the Pliocene and progressing eastward during the Quaternary. Faults that are seemingly un-correlated onland and in the marine areas become remarkably aligned when the Marmaris-Rhodes Block is progressively rotated by 6 degrees counterclockwise relative to the Mugla Block using a pole position located within the Gulf of Gokova. The scissor-like opening of the westernmost regions of the Maya Graben likely occurred during the late Pliocene, whereas the central and eastern portions of the graben developed during the early-middle Pleistocene and late Pleistocene-Holocene, respectively. The onset of the opening of the westernmost segment of the Golcova-Nisyros-Karpathos Graben occurred at a time earlier than the late Pliocene. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The formation age of the Siberian cratonic mantle is not well established as yet. Re-Os data on various mantle-derived materials have shown that it contains Archaean components, but the reported Re-depletion ages show a broad variation range (3.4 to 1 Ga) and are commonly &lt;= 2 Ga for peridotite xenoliths. We report Hf and Nd isotope data for cpx and garnet separated from nine refractory spinel and garnet peridotite xenoliths from the Udachnaya kimberlite. The cpx from low-opx spinel harzburgites show extremely high epsilon Hf values, from +607 t o+ 2084, which testify to long-term evolution of these rocks with high Lu/Hf ratios, consistent with their residual origin and near absence of post-melting enrichments in the Lu-Hf system. Such high eHf values are unusual for cpx from other cratonic peridotites and are higher than those reported for depleted cpx in off-cratonic peridotites. The clinopyroxenes from low-opx spinel harzburgites yield Hf model ages from 1.9 to 1.7 Ga while the cpx from high-opx spinel harzburgites yield Hf model ages from 3.0 to 1.9 Ga. When plotted together, they define a Lu/Hf isochron with an age of 1.80 Ga, which we consider as a robust estimate of the formation age (melt extraction event) because it is obtained on residual rocks that show no evidence for HREE and Hf enrichments and because the model ages for three out of four individual samples are similar to each other. The cpx have high epsilon Nd of +94 to +123, which are inconsistent with their low Sm/Nd-PM of &lt;1 and yield no meaningful age estimates. The consistently high, positive eNd in these cpxs can be interpreted in terms of long-term evolution of refractory peridotites with high Sm/Nd, followed by relatively recent LREE enrichments.
   <br>We infer that a significant part of the lithospheric mantle in the central Siberian craton may have been formed during a major event (or a series of events) at around 1.8 Ga. Older ages reported for the central Siberian craton may refer to less common materials from cratonic or other domains formed in the Archaean that were later incorporated into the cratonic roots. The transition from the "Archaean" to "modern" tectonic regimes in Siberia and possibly elsewhere may have taken place at 1.8-1.9 Ga rather than at similar to 2.5 Ga, i.e. in the second half of the Paleoproterozoic rather than at the Archaean-Proterozoic boundary, at which time the asthenospheric mantle became generally too cold to experience high-degree melting on a large scale. The similar to 1.8 Ga formation age of the Siberian cratonic mantle is coeval with that for a major part of the ancient continental crust in the central Siberian craton. The temporal crust-mantle links may be explained either by the generation of the initial source materials for continental crust in the same melting event that formed the residual peridotites or, alternatively, by subduction and melting of pre-existing proto-lithosphere destabilized by a major mantle upwelling that formed the residual mantle.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>To better understand the evolution of the South China Craton (SCC), we have determined the geochronological and geochemical compositions of newly recognized Grenville-aged metabasalts in the Shennongjia region of the northern Yangtze block. LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating of zircons indicates that the metabasalts formed at 1063 +/- 16Ma. The rocks are calc-alkaline, are characterized by SiO2 contents (50.50 to 55.62wt.%), and have moderate-to-high MgO contents (7.25-9.60wt.%). They display light rare earth element enrichment ((La/Yb)(N)=7.0-9.8) with slightly negative Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu*=0.82-0.90) and have pronounced depletion in high-field strength elements as well as positive Pb anomalies in the primitive mantle-normalized trace element pattern. They possess high initial Sr isotopic ratios of 0.7092-0.7107, large negative epsilon(Nd)(t) values of -12.1 to -11.0, and a relatively narrow range of initial Pb isotope ratios (Pb-206/Pb-204=16.503-17.019, Pb-207/Pb-204=15.259-15.452, and Pb-208/Pb-204=36.169-36.994). These isotopic characteristics are typical of basalts derived from an EM2 source region and suggest a subcontinental lithospheric mantle source that was metasomatized by subducted components (fluids and melts). Integrating our new data with documented igneous and metamorphic events during late Mesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic time in the region and western segments of the Yangtze block, we suggest that the Shennongjia area might be a microcontinent that was independent of the continental nucleus of the Yangtze block and was accreted to the Yangtze block at the end of Mesoproterozoic time. This study thus argues against the traditional view that the SCC was formed simply by Yangtze-Cathaysia collision and supports a hypothesis in which the Yangtze block was a collage of microcontinents accreted during the Grenvillian period accompanying the assembly of the Rodinia supercontinent.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Zircon geochronology using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, combined with a new detailed geological map and a stratigraphic study of the Parautochthon at the eastern rim of the Morais Allochthonous Complex, has provided new insights into the evolution of the Iberian Variscan belt. The data confirmed that the Parautochthon is composed of two structural units. The higher and more deformed, called the Upper Parautochthon, consists of recumbently folded pre-Variscan low-grade metasediments deposited in the northern Gondwana passive margin during the opening of the Rheic Ocean. It represents the Variscan tectonic duplication of the NW Iberian autochthonous sedimentary sequence triggered by the advance of a stack of allochthonous units formed previously in an accretionary prism. Below this unit, the Lower Parautochthon is a less pervasively deformed tectonic slice including two lithostratigraphic units (Travanca and Vila Cha formations) composed of Culm-type synorogenic low-grade metasediments deposited in a tectonic trench located between the accretionary prism and a peripheral bulge, with detrital zircon age populations pointing to a Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous age. These sediments were subsequently detached from the Autochthon along mechanically weak Silurian carbonaceous slates. The provenance study on the detrital zircons implies that this basin was fed mainly from the active margin.</td>

The structural location of the studied objects in the accretion-collision zone evidences that the subduction of the Kokchetav microcontinent beneath the Vendian-Cambrian Ishim-Selety island arc is the main mechanism of transport of graphite-bearing terrigenous-carbonate rocks to zones of their transformation into diamond-bearing metamorphic rocks. The sedimentary rocks of the Kokchetav microcontinent, which are enriched in graphite and iron sulfides and carbonates, contain all components necessary for diamond crystallization in deep-seated subduction zone. This is in agreement with the experimental data and the compositions of fluid-melt inclusions in the minerals of diamond-bearing rocks. (C) 2015, V.S. Sobolev IGM, Siberian Branch of the RAS.

The rapid and strong uplifting of peripheral mountains and large-scale activities of boundary faults led to rapid subsidence and strong tectonic deformation of some marginal depressions in this basin, such as Kuqa, Southwest Tarim and Southeast Tarim, which is of great significance to the hydrocarbon generation and accumulation. This work uses well logs and seismic section interpretations as well as previous studies. The conclusions are as follows: The Neotectonic movement of the marginal depressions began in the Miocene and went through four major evolutionary stages; the strong compression, thrust-faulting or strike-slip movements occurred in the neotectonic period, leading to the formation of large-scale foredeep depressions and subsidence zones, with intermittent uplifting and erosion; the tectonic activities differ significantly at different stages and in different depressions, and it was dominated by subsidence in the Pliocene and Early Pleistocene, while in the Middle and Late Pleistocene to present day, it was dominated by uplifting and erosion; The structures of the marginal depressions developed in rows, ordering from the foreland to the basin; Neotectonic movement has played an important role in the control of the formation, evolution and accumulation of gas reservoirs in the marginal depressions.

Faults are developed widely, but their geometrical features, kinematics and mechanisms of formation remained so far unclear, which severely limited exploration activities. With new 3D seismic data, the faults have been described by using the seismic coherence technique and reliably interpreted as having strike-slip kinematics. In map view the faults of the Tazhong Northern Faulted Slope converge at the southeast and diverge toward the northwest in a bird-foot shape. Their structural features accord with a transtensional mechanism of the anticlockwise internal rotation points to the divergence and clockwise external rotation points to the convergence. Their primary activities occurred in the Variscan orogeny. The NE strike-slip faults are left-lateral, belong to a conjugate Riedel shear (R') with respect to Riedel shear (R) faults of NW-striking dextral strike-slip faults. The faults affect the carbonate reservoirs of the Yingshan Formation along with triggering of karstification and mobilization of deep hydrothermal fluids, greatly improving the reservoir quality. The strike-slip faults created also the pathways for oil, gas and other fluids, and controlled the oil/gas distribution. The fracture-void reservoirs are deeper and closer to the strike-slip fault (SSF1 similar to SSF12) below the unconformity of top Yingshan Formation, well developed in extensional domains of the strike-slip system. The distance of 0.3-5.0 km from these strike-slip faults was favorable for hydrocarbons production, and the production efficiency decreasing at smaller and longer distances from the strike-slip faults. The local structural highs near the intersection zones of the strike-slip faults with thrust faults are often favorable for hydrocarbon accumulation. The geochemical features of oil and gas change regularly along strike-slip faults. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

The Almogholagh pluton (similar to 200 km(2)), located in the northern Sanandaj-Sirjan zone, is thought to have formed along this convergent plate boundary at some time between the late Mesozoic and early Cenozoic. The pluton is intrusive into the Triassic-Jurassic Hamedan phyllites. Here we present geochemical, Sr-Nd isotopic and U-(Th)-Pb titanite data for monzonitic rocks of this complex. The rocks are metaluminous and belong to the low-K calc-alkaline magma series. Silica-rich samples exhibit an affinity to A-type granites as testified by their high Zr, Nb, Ce, Y and low Ba and Sr concentrations. Field investigation, petrography and U-(Th)-Pb titanite dating demonstrate that the Almogholagh pluton emplaced syntectonically during regional deformation between late Jurassic and early Cretaceous times. Subsequently, parts of the pluton, along brittle-ductile shear zones, were metamorphosed under lower greenschist-facies conditions. Monzonites and monzodiorites of the Almogholagh pluton are characterized by low initial Sr-87/Sr-86 (0.7045, 0.7058) and positive epsilon Nd(t) values (2.7, 2.8). These features are in line with derivation by partial melting of mafic rocks in the lower crust. The overall tectonic regime was characterized by melt formation, ascent and emplacement along an active continental margin of the Sanandaj-Sirjan zone during a period of arc extension.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>A holistic approach is adopted here to evaluate basin-wide trends in carbonate systems, their subenvironments and the potential marine biodiversity partitioning between different habitats within the Coral Triangle biodiversity hotspot in central Southeast Asia. The Central Indonesian Kutai Basin is typical of many Cenozoic Southeast Asian basins in having extensive and varied carbonate systems, and is one of the few regions in the Coral Triangle with detailed systematic multitaxon evaluation of Oligo-Miocene deposits. The Kutai Basin may therefore provide data, when compared with other modern and global datasets, to better understand marine biodiversity development within the global diversity foci. Carbonate systems in the Kutai Basin included small-scale ephemeral features, such as delta-associated patch reefs, mixed carbonate-clastic shelves, and large-scale (&gt;10 km) land-attached and isolated carbonate platforms affected by varied energy regimes. Twenty-five-plus subenvironments or habitats are spread across the different carbonate systems, with the large-scale platforms hosting over 12-15 different habitats. These subenvironments include clastic-influenced mesophotic coral reefs/carpets, nonclastic- and clastic-influenced sea-grass beds, downslope reworked coral rubble, and shallow low-energy inner platform areas, to name a few. Perhaps paradoxically, the systems that two decades ago were almost unstudied, the clastic-influenced coral reefs/carpets, are now the only ones in the region to have been systematically studied for their marine biota. Detailed biotic studies have therefore only investigated &lt; 4 of the 25-plus potentially habitable carbonate subenvironments within the basin. This variability of carbonate systems and their subenvironments, but paucity of detailed biotic data is typical of many basins within equatorial Southeast Asia. It is recognized that detailed multitaxon biotic studies are in their infancy for Southeast Asia, and that there are challenges of taxonomic bias and/or preservation for many groups within the fossil record. Currently, however, we cannot evaluate marine biodiversity partitioning across the varied habitat mosaics of Southeast Asian carbonate systems with possible pathways discussed for furthering this field of research. It is likely that we are (? grossly) underestimating biodiversity on a basin-wide and probably a system-wide scale. It is hoped that studies of this type will contribute towards better understanding of equatorial marine carbonate systems, their biological inhabitants and producers, and the spatio-temporal development of global biodiversity hotspots.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The availability of accurate and reliable age control is a crucial prerequisite for palaeoclimate studies, particularly when different archives are to be compared. Here we present a detailed depth-to-time transformation for the lacustrine sediments of a similar to 940-m-long drill core (SG-1) from the western Qaidam Basin (NE Tibetan Plateau). To establish a more precise age model than the one previously available, whichwas based solely on magnetostratigraphic dating using polarity boundaries as tie points, we applied time-series analysis on magnetic susceptibility (chi) variation. The chi data are available in high resolution and are considered to be closely linked to orbital forcing. Since the sediment accumulation rate (SAR) varies strongly throughout the succession of core SG-1, conventional cyclostratigraphy by bandpass filtering cannot be applied. We present two alternative age models based on spectral characteristics and orbital tuning. The first age model (TPspec) is based on the assumption that changes in SAR occurred when the frequency spectra revealed obviously different characteristics in the spectral pattern. For the second age model (SARA), SAR was adjusted every 2 m by comparing observed with expected orbital cycles in accordance with the age of magnetic reversals. This age model appears more robust and shows the most convincing spectral results in the frequency and wavelet power spectrum of chi. According to the SARA age model, SAR varies between 14 and 73 cm kyr(-1), and the bottom of SG-1 has an age of 2.69 Ma. Our results show that orbital tuning can be successfully applied for sequences with strongly variable SAR. The age model SARA can be used for a more detailed analysis of the existing multiproxy data set in terms of palaeoclimate evolution. The most prominent feature of chi spectra using the SARA age model is the identification of the middle Pleistocene transition.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>We present a revised interpretation of magnetic anomalies and fracture zones on the Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR; Africa-Antarctica) and the Southeast Indian Ridge (SEIR; Capricorn-Antarctica) and use them to calculate 2-plate finite rotations for anomalies 34 to 20 (84 to 43 Ma). Central Indian Ridge (CIR; Capricorn-Africa) rotations are calculated by summing the SWIR and SEIR rotations. These rotations provide a high-resolution record of changes in the motion of India and Africa at the time of the onset of the Reunion plume head. An analysis of the relative velocities of India, Africa and Antarctica leads to a refinement of previous observations that the speedup of India relative to the mantle was accompanied by a slowdown of Africa. The most rapid slowdown of Africa occurs around Chron 32Ay (71 Ma), the time when India's motion relative to Africa notably starts to accelerate. Using the most recent Geomagnetic Polarity Timescale (GTS12) we show that India's velocity relative to Africa was characterized by an acceleration from roughly 60 to 180 mm yr(-1) between 71 and 66 Ma, a short pulse of superfast motion (similar to 180 mm yr(-1)) between 66 and 63 Ma, an abrupt slowdown to 120 mm yr(-1) between 63 and 62 Ma, and then a long period (63 to 47 Ma) of gradual slowing, but still fast motion (similar to 100 mm yr(-1)), which ends with a rapid slowdown after Chron 21o (47 Ma). Changes in the velocities of Africa and India with respect to the mantle follow a similar pattern. The fastest motion of India relative to the mantle, similar to 220 mm yr(-1), occurs during Chron 29R. The SWIR rotations constrain three significant changes in the migration path of the Africa-Antarctic stage poles: following Chron 33y (73 Ma), following Chron 31y (68 Ma), and following Chron 24o (54 Ma). The change in the migration path of the SWIR stage poles following Chron 33y is coincident with the most rapid slowdown in Africa's motion. The change in the migration path after Chron 31y, although coincident with the most rapid acceleration of India's northward motion, may be related to changes in ridge push forces on the SWIR associated with the onset of extension along the Bain transform fault zone. The initial slowdown in India's motion relative to Africa between 63 and 62 Ma is more abrupt than predictions based on published plume head force models, suggesting it might have been caused by a change in plate boundary forces. The abrupt change in the migration path of the SWIR stage poles after Chron 24o is not associated with major changes in the velocities of either Africa or India and may reflect Atlantic basin plate motion changes associated with the arrival at the Earth's surface of the Iceland plume head. The abruptness of India's slowdown after Chron 21o is consistent with a collision event.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The East Kunlun Fault zone, striking E-W to WNW-ESE, has been recognized as one of the largest and most active left-lateral strike-slip faults in the China continent. Presently, the Maqin-Maqu segment (MMS) is recognized as a seismic gap on the East Kunlun Fault. Since several highly populated counties are close to this region, understanding stress transfer and accumulation along this segment is important for hazard assessment along the MMS. In this study, we calculated the stress evolution along the MMS of the East Kunlun Fault zone during 1879-2008 by integrating coseismic effects, viscoelastic relaxation and tectonic loading. It is observed that the stress accumulation on the western part of the Maqin segment has been effected by the 1937 Tuosuo Lake earthquake, the stress on the eastern part of the Maqin segment. Also, the western part of the Maqu segment was relaxed by the 1947 Dari earthquake, and the stress loading on the eastern part of Maqu segment was increased by both the 1879 Wudu and 2008 Wenchuan earthquakes. It is observed that, compared to coseismic static stress changes, the post-seismic viscoelastic relaxation process has played a more important role on stress accumulation in the Maqu segment. The increased stress on the Maqin and Maqu segment is consistent with tectonic loading over 160 and 250 yr, respectively, which we expect will lead to future earthquakes and associated seismic hazard on these segments.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>We evaluate how the growth and interaction of active normal faults in the Sperchios Basin and Northern Gulf of Evia, Greece, are recorded by the landscape. We demonstrate that patterns in footwall relief along the faults reflect fault segmentation, and we show that in this study area, fault throw is 2 to 3 times the maximum footwall relief. Rivers crossing the faults typically have two knickpoints, which are unrelated to lithology. However, their heights, measured from the active fault trace, vary systematically. The height of the upper set of knickpoints scales linearly with the footwall relief of the faults and is typically &gt;85% of the maximum relief. The height of the lower set of knickpoints also scales with footwall relief, but the heights are consistently lower. The existence of two sets of knickpoints suggests that the rivers have been perturbed by two changes in tectonic rates during faulting. We interpret the upper knickpoints to represent the initiation and growth of fault-generated topography, while the lower set of knickpoints reflects a throw rate increase due to fault linkage. Estimates of throw rate enhancement factor derived from fault interaction theory suggest that the faults increased their rate by a factor of 3 when they linked. This constraint, combined with the distribution of knickpoint heights, allows us to estimate the throw rate and linkage time for the faults. The Sperchios Fault has a maximum throw rate of 1.5-2.0mm/yr, while the Coastal Fault has a maximum throw rate of 0.8-1.2mm/yr.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Due to its complex history of deformation, the California Continental Borderland provides an interesting geological setting for studying how the oceanic and continental lithosphere responds to deformation. We map variations in present-day lithospheric structure across the region using Ps and Sp receiver functions at permanent stations of the Southern California Seismic Network as well as ocean bottom seismometer (OBS) data gathered by the Asthenospheric and Lithospheric Broadband Architecture from the California Offshore Region Experiment (ALBACORE), which enhances coverage of the borderland and provides first direct constraints on the structure of the Pacific plate west of the Patton Escarpment. Noisiness of OBS data makes strict handpicking and bandpass filtering necessary in order to obtain interpretable receiver functions. Using H-kappa and common-conversion point stacking, we find pronounced lithospheric differences across structural blocks, which we interpret as indicating that the Outer Borderland has been translated with little to no internal deformation, while the Inner Borderland underwent significant lithospheric thinning, most likely related to accommodating the 90 degrees clockwise rotation of the Western Transverse Range block. West of the Patton Escarpment, we find that the transition to typical oceanic crustal thickness takes place over a lateral distance of similar to 50 km. We detect an oceanic seismic lithosphere-asthenosphere transition at 58 km depth west of the Patton Escarpment, consistent with only weak age-dependence of the depth to the seismic lithosphere-asthenosphere transition. Sp common-conversion point stacks confirm wholesale lithospheric thinning of the Inner Borderland and suggest the presence of a slab fragment beneath the Outer Borderland.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Paleomagnetic dating of the India-Asia collision hinges on determining the Paleogene latitude of the Lhasa terrane (southern Tibet). Reported latitudes range from 5 degrees N to 30 degrees N, however, leading to contrasting paleogeographic interpretations. Here we report new data from the Eocene Linzizong volcanic rocks in the Nanmulin Basin, which previously yielded data suggesting a low paleolatitude (similar to 10 degrees N). New zircon U-Pb dates indicate an age of similar to 52Ma. Negative fold tests, however, demonstrate that the isolated characteristic remanent magnetizations, with notably varying inclinations, are not primary. Rock magnetic analyses, end-member modeling of isothermal remanent magnetization acquisition curves, and petrographic observations are consistent with variable degrees of posttilting remagnetization due to low-temperature alteration of primary magmatic titanomagnetite and the formation of secondary pigmentary hematite that unblock simultaneously. Previously reported paleomagnetic data from the Nanmulin Basin implying low paleolatitude should thus not be used to estimate the time and latitude of the India-Asia collision. We show that the paleomagnetic inclinations vary linearly with the contribution of secondary hematite to saturation isothermal remanent magnetization. We tentatively propose a new method to recover a primary remanence with inclination of 38.1 degrees (35.7 degrees, 40.5 degrees) (95% significance) and a secondary remanence with inclination of 42.9 degrees (41.5 degrees,44.4 degrees) (95% significance). The paleolatitude defined by the modeled primary remanence21 degrees N (19.8 degrees N, 23.1 degrees N)is consistent with the regional compilation of published results from pristine volcanic rocks and sedimentary rocks of the upper Linzizong Group corrected for inclination shallowing. The start of the Tibetan Himalaya-Asia collision was situated at similar to 20 degrees N and took place by similar to 50Ma.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In the Basilicata region (South Italy) slope movements, caused by soft rocks, rapid tectonic uplift, earthquakes, and seasonally heavy precipitation, constitute one of the major geologic hazards. For this reason a detailed inventory map of mass movements has been created in a test area of south-eastern Basilicata. The map was compiled from field surveys and multitemporal air photo interpretation. For each landslide, the map depicts the state of activity and dominant type of slope movement. The integration and analysis of the data obtained by using a geographic information system has produced the mass movements inventory map at a scale of 1:25,000.
   <br>Mass movements are widespread and play a key role in the landscape evolution of the study area. A total of 175 landslides were recognized, occupying a surface area of 16.2 km(2), about 9% of the whole basin of interest. The spatial distribution and type of mass movements are mainly related to the lithology and structural features. Field surveys coupled with interpretation of multi-temporal aerial photos allowed us to distinguish between active (20.6%) and inactive (79.4%) landslides. Mass movements, mapped on the basis of movement type, are represented by slides, flows and complex landslides. The complex and slide type movements are very common, and represent more than 86% of the landslides mapped.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>One of the most challenging aspects of managing a volcanic crisis is the interpretation of the monitoring data, so as to anticipate to the evolution of the unrest and implement timely mitigation actions. An unrest episode may include different stages or time intervals of increasing activity that may or may not precede a volcanic eruption, depending on the causes of the unrest (magmatic, geothermal or tectonic). Therefore, one of the main goals in monitoring volcanic unrest is to forecast whether or not such increase of activity will end up with an eruption, and if this is the case, how, when, and where this eruption will take place. As an alternative method to expert elicitation for assessing and merging monitoring data and relevant past information, we present a probabilistic method to transform precursory activity into the probability of experiencing a significant variation by the next time interval (i.e. the next step in the unrest), given its preceding evolution, and by further estimating the probability of the occurrence of a particular eruptive scenario combining monitoring and past data. With the 1991 Pinatubo volcanic crisis as a reference, we have developed such a method to assess short-term volcanic hazard using Bayesian inference. (C) 2014 The Authors.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In this paper we review the structure of the most external thrust belt of the Alps between the Rhein valley and Salzburg based on a new tectonic map and the (re)interpretation of seismic sections. Specifically we address the correlation between deformation in the Subalpine Molasse and the Alpine thrust belt in general and focus on the control of sedimentary facies on the structural style. A dramatic change in architecture from a ramp-flat structure to buckle folding is related to a change from coarse-grained fans to fine-grained deposits within the Subalpine Molasse. Additionally the interaction of escape tectonics with postcollisional shortening controls the decrease of late Early Miocene and younger shortening within the Subalpine Molasse from 50km near the Rhine valley to almost zero near Salzburg. Transfer of shortening into the hinterland, which is the zone of lateral escape, ended foreland propagation of the Alpine thrusts and initiated a general break-back sequence of thrusting. Throughout this time the thrusts remained active. In such a scenario, tectonic units on top of the Subalpine Molasse are expected to undergo clockwise rotation around vertical axes. As thrusting in the Subalpine Molasse is closely related to contemporaneous transport and shortening within the tectonically higher Helvetic thrust sheets, amounts of Miocene differential shortening and related clockwise vertical axis rotation are minimum amounts. True clockwise vertical axis rotation is probably larger than the 12 degrees deduced from the Subalpine Molasse thrust belt.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Galchhi shear zone underlies the Kathmandu klippe in central Nepal and has emerged as a key structure for discriminating competing models for the formation of the Himalayan orogenic wedge. New chronologic data from the Galchhi area suggest a new structural and orogenic interpretation. Zircons from quartzites and an orthogneiss restrict protolith deposition to between 467+7/-10Ma and similar to 570Ma, with metamorphic zircon growth at 23-29Ma. Comparable data from the Greater Himalayan Sequence (GHS) at the intra-GHS Langtang thrust, north of Galchhi, similarly restrict GHS deposition to between 475+7/ - 3 and similar to 660Ma. Undeformed pegmatites near Galchhi constrain movement of the Galchhi shear zone to 22.52.3Ma, long before slip of the Main Central Thrust in the region (17Ma). Shear sense indicators in the Galchhi area indicate both top-to-the-south and top-to-the-north shears. The old age of movement, Neoproterozoic youngest detrital zircons, occurrence of top-to-the-south shear sense indicators, and intrusive Paleozoic granites, all suggest that the Galchhi shear zone is an intra-GHS top-to-the-south thrust, rather than either a thrust involving Lesser Himalayan rocks, or a top-to-the-north shear zone that juxtaposed Tethyan and GHS rocks during coeval movement of the Main Central Thrust. The GHS in Nepal was not emplaced as a single body of rock but consists of at least two ductile thrust sheets, present in both the hinterland at Langtang and toward the foreland at Galchhi. GHS thrust sheets sequentially underplated during southward propagation of the thrust belt.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Mesozoic basins in northwest China provide important records for investigating relationships between intraplate deformation in Central Asia and tectonic processes at Asian boundaries. The present study, using well, seismic, outcrop, and thermochronology data in the Junggar Basin and neighboring areas, describes the main features of Jurassic strata in the basin, analyzes the Jurassic evolution of the basin and neighboring mountain belts, and discusses possible mechanisms of Jurassic intraplate deformation in Central Asia. During the Early-Middle Jurassic, episodic uplift of surrounding mountain belts kept the Junggar Basin a contractional closed basin, and alluvial fan, fluvial, delta, and lacustrine depositional environments successively developed from surrounding ranges to the central basin. During the Late Jurassic, the western and central parts of the basin were folded and uplifted, and deposition migrated mainly to the eastern basin. During the latest Jurassic-earliest Cretaceous, pre-Cretaceous strata in the eastern and northeastern Junggar Basin were folded and uplifted, and coarse-grained sediments were transported from surrounding uplifts to the central basin. We suggest that Jurassic episodic deformation events in the Junggar Basin and other areas of Central Asia are related to the Qiangtang collision during the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic, the closure of the western Mongol-Okhotsk Ocean at the Early/Middle Jurassic boundary, a collision of a microcontinent in the Pamir with the southern Asian margin during the late Middle Jurassic-early Late Jurassic, the collision of the Kolyma-Omolon Block with Siberia at the end of the Jurassic, and the subsequent closure of the eastern Mongol-Okhotsk Ocean during the latest Jurassic-earliest Cretaceous.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In this study we use the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) and paleomagnetic data for deciphering the origin of magnetic lineation in weakly deformed sedimentary rocks and for evaluating oroclinal processes within the Arabia-Eurasia collision zone. In particular, we have analyzed the Miocene Upper Red Formation (URF) from the outer curved front of the southern Central Alborz Mountains of north Iran, to test for the first time with paleomagnetic data the origin (primary versus secondary) of this orogenic arc. AMS data document the existence of a magnetic lineation parallel to the orientation of the major tectonic structures, which vary along strike from WNW to ENE. These directions are highly oblique to the paleoflow directions and hence suggest that the magnetic lineation in the URF was produced by compressional deformation during layer-parallel shortening. In addition, our paleomagnetic data document clockwise and anticlockwise rotations along vertical axis for the western and eastern sectors of the Central Alborz Mountains, respectively. Combined, our results suggest that the orogen represents an orocline, which formed not earlier than circa 7.6Ma most likely through bending processes caused by the relative motion between the rigid crustal blocks of the collision zone. Moreover, our study provides new insights into the Iran-Southern Caspian Basin kinematic evolution suggesting that the present-day SW motion of the South Caspian Basin with respect to Central Iran postdates oroclinal bending and hence cannot be as old as late Miocene to early Pliocene but a rather recent configuration (i.e., 3 to &lt;1Ma).</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The El Salvador Fault Zone (ESFZ) is an active, approximately 150 km long and 20 km wide, segmented, dextral strike-slip fault zone within the Central American Volcanic Arc striking N100 degrees E. Although several studies have investigated the surface expression of the ESFZ, little is known about its structure at depth and its kinematic evolution. Structural field data and mapping suggest a phase of extension, at some stage during the evolution of the ESFZ. This phase would explain dip-slip movements on structures that are currently associated with the active, dominantly strike slip and that do not fit with the current tectonic regime. Field observations suggest trenchward migration of the arc. Such an extension and trenchward migration of the volcanic arc could be related to slab rollback of the Cocos plate beneath the Chortis Block during the Miocene/Pliocene. We carried out 4-D analog model experiments to test whether an early phase of extension is required to form the present-day fault pattern in the ESFZ. Our experiments suggest that a two-phase tectonic evolution best explains the ESFZ: an early pure extensional phase linked to a segmented volcanic arc is necessary to form the main structures. This extensional phase is followed by a strike-slip dominated regime, which results in intersegment areas with local transtension and segments with almost pure strike-slip motion. The results of our experiments combined with field data along the Central American Volcanic Arc indicate that the slab rollback intensity beneath the Chortis Block is greater in Nicaragua and decreases westward to Guatemala.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In the easternmost part of the main Izeh Zone of the Zagros Mountains, Iran, the Asmari carbonate platform system of Oligo-Miocene age is superbly exposed in three-dimensional outcrops displaying a variety of carbonate facies associated with well-preserved depositional geometries. The main biogenic components of the Asmari Formation are large benthic foraminifera, corals, coralline algae, and planktonic foraminifera. The Asmari carbonate platform system, based on dating by large benthic foraminifera, biogenic components, and depositional geometries, is divided into four distinct intervals of carbonate platform growth. This depositional system during the Rupelian and Rupelian/ earliest Chattian was a carbonate ramp. During the Chattian, the system was dominated by coral buildups, and later, porcellaneous benthic foraminifera and coralline algae were prominent during late Chattian- early Miocene time. Six major depositional sequences are distinguished, with an overall systematic progradation from NE to SW. These progradations are evidenced in the Rupelian and lower Chattian by major changes in facies and stratal architectures, whereas such complex geometries are not observed in the upper Chattian and lower Miocene carbonates, since only platform-top facies are exposed and there are no outcrops of the platform margin. Comparison of the proposed depositional sequences with those reported in the Dezful Embayment and adjacent areas suggests a correlation with the global sea-level curve.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Laojunshan mining district is an important part of the SE Yunnan W-Sn polymetallic mineral belt. Previous geochronologic data have shown that the main metallogenic stages in this area are Indosinian and Yanshanian in age. In this paper, we present a new dating result that differs from those published previously by using the in situ LA-MC-ICP-MS geochronologic method on a cassiterite sample from the giant Xinzhai tin deposit. Analyses of this sample yielded a U-Pb Tera Wasserburg age of 419.1 +/- 6.7 Ma. This new date identifies a Caledonian metallogenic event at the Xinzhai tin deposit and this age is also consistent with Caledonian magmatic and tectonic activity previously recognized in the Laojunshan mining district. Therefore, not only Yanshanian and Indosinian metallogenic stages but also a Caledonian mineralization event must have occurred in the study area. This new result may play an important role in ore prospecting and metallogenic study in the Laojunshan mining district and, more importantly, in all of SE Yunnan.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In this study, we performed U-Pb dating on 1295 zircon grains from 24 samples originating from the North China Craton (NCC); an additional 440 Lu-Hf isotopic analyses were conducted on select zircon grains. The U Pb ages revealed that the strongest magmatic event in the NCC occurred ca. 2.5 Ga, and a subordinate magmatic event occurred ca. 1.8 Ga. The crustal model ages from Hf isotopic analyses showed that the best estimate for the age of the NCC mantle extraction is ca. 2.8-2.7 Ga, which is consistent with the age of global continental crusts. In recent years, numerous 2.7 Ga rocks have been identified within the NCC. A strong and widespread superimposed tectono-thermal event at ca. 2.5 Ga differentiates the NCC from many other worldwide cratons. However, the timing of the majority of NCC continental crust growth remains highly controversial. In this paper, a quantitative method was used to calculate a continental crust reworking rate. The results revealed that the lowest reworking rate in the NCC occurred at ca. 2.7 Ga and was below 13%. At 2.9 Ga, the reworking rate was 73%, suggesting that a strong intra-crustal magmatic event took place at that time. Combining the reworking rates and Hf isotopic model ages for each period, we concluded that approximately 25% and 23% of the continental crust volume in the NCC was formed at ca. 2.8 Ga and 2.7 Ga, respectively. Approximately 12% of the continental crust volume formed at 2.6 Ga, and only 6% of the continental crust formed at ca. 2.5 Ga. Even with a high reworking rate, 6% of the continental crust formed at 2.9 Ga. Therefore, the main continental crustal growth in the North China Craton occurred at ca. 2.8-2.7 Ga (48% continental crust).</td>

The results show that the phenocryst (about 15%) and matrix (about 85%) mainly consist of quartz, K-feldspar and plagioclase. The rock is composed of low content of Si and high content of Al2O3, low contents of Ca, Fe2O3, Na, TiO2, etc. The intrusion rock has the medium alkali content, attributing to K-rich type rock; and contains medium to low REE contents, of which light rare earth elements (LREEs) and heavy rare earth elements (HREEs) are highly fractionated, showing a weak negative Ce anomaly and a negative Eu anomaly. These rocks are enriched in LREE, and the large ion lithophytes elements (LILE) are rich in Rb, Sr, and U; the high-field-strength elements (Nb, Th, etc) are relatively depleted. The REE chondrite-normalized patterns are consistent with the overall, roughly indicating their similar characteristics, sources and evolution. The intrusion rock mainly formed during the collisional and within-plate periods.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>At present there exist different understandings about the structural settings of northern part of North China (including the northern margin of North China Craton and Hinggan-Mongolia Orogenic Belt) in the Permian. According to an influential viewpoint, evolution of the Paleo-Asian Ocean has continued until the end of Permian or the beginning of Triassic, with the northern margin of North China Craton becoming an "Andes-type continental margin" as a result of oceanic plate subducting toward underneath the North China Craton. And the active continental margin has correspondingly changed from an early state of subdaction-convergence (C-2) to a late state of detachment of subducting plate and extention of continental margin (P-2-T1-2). Such an understanding is largely based on evidences of magmatism. This viewpoint will be discussed in this paper in terms of sedimentary formation, deformation, metamorphism and regional tectonic settings with respect to the continental crust evolution of the concerned area in the Late Paleozoic, and the whole process of evolution will be divided into three stages according to our understanding: (1) the climactic orogeny of Hingga-Mongolia Orogenic Belt in the Middle Devonian before Famennian; (2) the post-collision in the Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous; and (3) the non-orogenic extension in the Late Carboniferous-Early Permian, when the young continental crust of Hingga-Mongolia Orogenic Belt under the extensional settings produces newly-born rifts, which-instead of any oceanic plate-controls the concurrent sedimentation and magmatism. All the geological events of the three stages have their expressions in the northern margin of North China Craton. The isotopic ages of plutonic rocks from the area show three peak values: Middle-Late Devonian, Early Permian, and Late Permian. The rock assemblages and Sr-Nd isotopic characteristics of plutonic rocks of Early Permian (280Ma) and Late Permian (260Ma) are particularly studied to reveal magma generation. It is seen from the R-1-R-2, diagram that the Permian plutonic rock assemblages in this area are different from the Andes-type orogenic zones which are mainly consisted of tonalite and granodiorite. The Early Permian plutonic rocks have bimodal character and closer relations with EMI-type mantle sources as shown by their Sr-Nd isotopic features. Inspired by a previous study on the primary magma in Gaositai, it is further supposed that there has been an upwelling process of intraplate OIB-type magma along the lithospheric faults in northern margin of North China Craton in the Early Permian. In contrast, the Late Permian plutonic rocks are mainly syenogranite and monzonitic granite with higher alkaline degree, these intermediate-acidic rocks possess the features of high-alkaline or high-potassium, and their Sr-Nd isotopic characteristics show a trend of the magmatic sources evolving toward EMII-type, with the increased melting materials of the middle-upper crust suggesting uprising of the thermal belt. In summary, such evidences as from magma generation, magma-reservoir developmental, and space-time distribution of the magma all prove that formation of the Permian plutonic rocks is related more with the intraplate thermal evolution, different from that of Andes-type orogenic zones. Hinggan-Mongolia Orogenic Belt belongs to Central Asian Orogenic Belt and can be examined within broader tectonic settings.
   <br>There are 8 belts of Late Paleozoic and Mesozoic peralkaline and alkaline (alkali-feldspar) granitoids and genetically related bimodal volcanics in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt. These tectonomagmatic belts stretch over thousands kilometers, their NE strike represents a new tectonic framework, and their isotopic characteristics of high epsilon(Nd)(t) and low epsilon(Sr)(t) reflect repeated activities of rifts under extensional settings. The Central Asian Orogenic Belt on the whole as a young continental crust, together with North China Craton and Tarim block, has entered a new evolutional stage since the beginning of Early Permian. If cratonization of forming progress of the continental lithosphere is studied, the Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous of Central Asian Orogenic Belt is the first stage of cratonization after collision, and the second stage of cratonization begins in the Late Carboniferous-Early Permian, when new zonal extensional structures emerge extensively, marking the importance of plutonic activities becoming increasingly obvious.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Late Paleozoic is considered as an important stage during the evolution of the western Tianshan. In this paper, we report the petrology, geochemistry of Permian Taerdeao bimodal volcanic rocks to characterize the post-collisional tectonic evolution in Late Paleozoic. The volcanic rocks in Permian Taerdetao Formation at Awulale area comprise mainly of basalts, basaltic andesites and rhyolites. Their SiO2 content varies from 49.1% similar to 76.0%, and exhibits a gap between 62.8% and 70.8%, display a good bimodal geochemical distribution. The basalts have high Ti, Nb (8.13 x 10(-6) similar to 14.9 x 10(-6)) and high field strength elements (HFSE), just like the charateristics of Nb-enriched basalts. The rhyolites are characterized by high SiO2, K2O + Na2O, FeOT, FeOT/MgO, and low Al2O3, CaO and MgO, enriched Th, Nb, Ta, Zr, Hf, Ga and Y, with the geochemical affinite of A-type granite. Both the basalts and rhyolites are enriched in light rare earth elements (LREE) and large ion lithophile elements (LILE), and are depleted in HFSE. Basalts, basaltic andesites and rhyolites have positive epsilon(Nd)(t) values (0.05 similar to 2.72). Based on Nd isotopic compositions and contents of major and trace elements, we suggest that all basalts, basaltic andesites and rhyolites of Permian Awulale Formation were formed by partial melting of a mantle contaminated by delaminated lower crust. Basaltic andesites and rhyolites have mainly originated by fractionation of primary mafic melt coupled with contamination of continental crust. This bimodal volcanism indicated western Tianshan was in extention environtment at Permian period. A-type granites in bimodal volcanic rocks can demonstrate that the North Tianshan Ocean was closed before Permian and entered the post-orogenic stage.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Mayile ophiolitic melange belt is one of the important Early Paleozoic ophiolite suites in the southern West Junggar, Xinjiang. It is controversial concerning the timing of opening and closure of the Mayile ancient oceanic basin. Based on detailed field investigations, Mayile ophiolitic melange emplaced in Middle-Upper Silurian Mayilashan Group flysch matrix or coexistenced closely with the Cambrian intrusive rocks in space. This indicates that Mayile ancient oceanic basin opened at least in the Cambrian. Observation along stratigraphic profiles suggest that there is angular unconformity between the Middle Devonian Kulumudi Formation and Mayilashan Group in lithologic characteristics, basic sequence, sedimentary environment. These reflect that early Late Paleozoic is a major transition period in the development of tectonic evolution of the West Junggar, and the deposition of continental sedimentary sequence in the lower part of Kulumudi Formation is a sedimentary response to the closure of Mayile Early Paleozoic ocean basin. Furthermore, this will provide important constraints on the tectonic evolution of the West Junggar orogenic belt and the tectonic framework of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) during the Paleozoic period.</td>

LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb age of granite is 416.7 +/- 4.3Ma (MSWD = 0.52), while that of quartz diorite and granodiotite are 442.5 +/- 4.7 (MSWD = 0.46) and 443.9 +/- 1.3Ma (MSWD = 0.17) respectively, indicating that two magmatic events have occurred in the study area The granite is peraluminous with high K/Na and K content, and low Mg, Fe and Ca content Meanwhile, it is enriched in high field strength elements, and depleted in large ion lithophile elements. Its Sigma REE is 122.0 x 10(-6) and delta Eu is 0.05 with significant Eu negative anomaly. In contrast, the granodiorite and quartz diorite are also peraluminous but are enriched in Na. They have a lower content of high field strength elements and a slightly higher content of large ion lithophile elements. Their Sigma REE range from 133.3 x 10(-6) to 247.6 x 10(-6) and delta Eu range from 0.73 to 1.09, showing no significant Eu anomalies. Based on these geochemical characteristics, we conclude that the granites belong to I-type granites and were produced by partial melting of continental crust in a post-orogenic extensional setting. In contrast, the granodiorites and quartz diorites are I-type granites and are likely to be the product of island arc magmatism, associated with oceanic subduction. These results are of key importance to constrain the tectonic evolution of Central-South Qilian.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Xinpu Mo deposit is situated in Ningshan County of southern Qinling and the mineralization hosted in granodiorite. The orebody generally occurs as veins and lenses in faults and cracks inner granodiorite. The ore types are divided into quartz vein type, tectonite-type and K-feldspar quartz vein type. The former two are the major ore type. Main elements analysis of the host granodiorite shows that they are high potassic calc-alkaline and calc-alkaline series, with depleted in SiO2, (56.85% similar to 65.45%), rich in Al2O3 (14.59% similar to 15.59%), Fe2O3T (4.81% similar to 6.41%), Mg-# (51.3 similar to 60.2), CaO (3.63% similar to 5.78%), low K2O/Na2O (0.45 similar to 0.71) and metaluminous rock (A/CNK = 0.73 similar to 0.96). The chondrite-normalized REE patterns are characterized by LREE enrichment with middle negative Eu anomalous (delta Eu = 0.7 similar to 0.83). The trace elements of the host rocks show high content of Sr, Ba and low content of Y, with high in Sr/Y, La/Yb. The Re-Os geochronological dating of five molybdenite separates from the major Mo mineralized bodies gives an isochron age of 197.0 +/- 1.6Ma and represents the ore-forming time of Mo mineralization belong to Early Jurassic. This age lag behind 10Ma to 30Ma of the emplacement of Late Triassic granitoids in southern Qinling. Base on Sr, Nd, Hf isotopic compositions of granites and regional tectonic evolution in southern Qinling, we conclude that the host rocks were emplaced during the transition regime from oceanic slab subduction to intercontinental collision. The granitoids belongs to the syntectic granite series and formed by adakitie melts which produced from magma mixing of partial melting of subdueted oceanic crust, overling mantle wedge and Early-Proterozoic upper crust. The Mo mineralization occurred in the intercontinental collision to post-collisional regime. We should pay more attention to Late Triassic to Early Jurassic intermediate-acid pluton for Mo exploration on the future.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Shilu iron ore deposit in Hainan Province is the largest hematite-rich deposit in China, associated with cobalt, copper and other polymetallic mineral resources. This deposit is largely hosted within the Neoproterozoic Shilu Group, a suite of low-garde, neritic siliciclastic and carbonate sedimentary succession with generally greenschist (locally up to amphibolite) facies metamorphism. The NWW-trending synclinorium is main ore-controlling structure for iron, cobalt and copper ore bodies in the district. Previous studies suggested that folding and associated ductile shearing and high-temperature plastic flow had played an important role in enrichment of iron, cobalt and copper metals. To confirm this, we carried out in situ analysis on chemical compositions and CHIME (total Th-U-Pb) dating on monazite from the proximal diopside-tremolite rocks in the Shilu Group, using electronic probe microanalysis (EPMA) on thin sections assisted by BSE image. Microscopic observation revealed an alignment of monazite parallel to regional foliation defined by low amphibolite-facies minerals, and that monazite was characterized by typical replacement of breakdown coronas with obviously mineral concentric zoning, i.e., monazite in the core successively ringed by apatite, allanite and epidote towards rims. EPMA analysis suggests that monazite is composed of cerium phosphate ((Ce, La, Nd, Th) PO4 with cheralite as the main end member. The typical occurrence, ThO2 contents (ranging from 0.78% to 4.61%) and REE pattern all indicate a metamorphic origin for studied monazite. CHIME dating results show that monazite yields the apparent ages ranging from 397Ma to 614Ma with a main age peak at 455Ma and a subordinate peak at 564Ma. Low contents of ThO2 (0.78% similar to 1.65%), PbO (0.02% similar to 0.04%) and CaO (0.50% similar to 0.97%), and high ratios of Th/U (23.06 similar to 53.11) could interpret monazite with ca. 564Ma age as production of the early deformational metamorphic event. Subsequent dissolution-reprecipitation of monazite, during the later shear deformation, caused patchy zonation and chemical alteration of crystallised monazite domains. This process finally reset the U-Th-Pb system by the aids of possible alkali-bearing metamorphic fluid, and yielded the main peak age of ca. 455Ma. The patchy domains have variable contents of ThO2 (0.92% similar to 4.61%), PbO (0.01% similar to 0.08%) and CaO (0.28% similar to 1.58%), and high Th/U ratios (24.83 similar to 52.86). The breakdown of monazite to the coronal minerals was most likely related to the process of post-deformational greenschist-facies retrograde metamorphism with the participation of possible Ca-, Fe-, Si-, Al-rich fluids by unbalance reaction. The reactive mechanism is elemental diffusion between monazite and coronas minerals, indicating that the REE, Y, and Th were mobile at a small scale and partial Pb loss may happened in the rim of monazite. In line with the tectonic development of south China, we suggested that the ca. 455Ma age likely recorded a regionally metamorphic event corresponding to South China Caledonian orogeny. Whereas the 564Ma age might be linked to Pan-African event, implying that South China had an affinity to Gondwanaland in late Neoproterozoic to early paleozoic. Based on the available age data, the Caledonian event in South China could be considered as the subsequently intracontinental orogeny corresponding to the assembly and collision of Gondwanaland.
   <br>Therefore, the Late Neoproterozoic to Early Paleozoic orogenic events might play an important role on the tectonic evolution of Hainan Island. Moreover, the orogenic event (s) had great significance for the enrichment of iron, cobalt and copper metals in the Shilu deposit.</td>

And the latter one could be subdivided into Early Jurassic I-type granitoids related Fe, Cu, Pb, Zn deposits; Late Jurassic S-type granitoids related W, Sn, Mo, Bi deposits; Lower Cretaceous intermediate-acid intrusive rocks related skarn-type Fe, Cu, Pb, Zn, Mo deposits; and Lower Cretaceous intermediate-acid intrusion-subvolcanism related Au, Ag, Cu, Mo, Pb, Zn, U deposits. After descriptions of the basic geological characteristics and spatial-temporal distribution of these deposits, it is suggested that Jinningian polymetallic VMS deposits were occurred in the Zhenghe-Dapu bimodal volcanic basin which were generated during the cracking process of South China continental block in Neoproterozoic, Hercynian-Indosinian magmatic-porphyry deposits were occurred in the intrusion process of intracontinental extension and extrusion, and Yanshanian deposits were generated in the intrusion-subvolcanism which were occurred in the alternate of intracontinental extension and extrusion in Pacific tectonic domain period.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Petrography, major, trace and rare earth element compositions of elastic rocks from Upper Triassic Xujiahe Formation, Lichuan area, southwestern Hubei Province, have been investigated to determine their weathering condition, provenance and tectonic setting. All sandstone samples are enriched in quartz (average 76.23%), but poor in lithic fragment (average 7.08%) and feldspar (average 4.88%). The mean value of Q/(Q + F + L) is 0.86. Heavy mineral assemblage constituted by zircon, brookite, magnetite and tourmaline supported an acidic or low-grade metamorphic source. The sandstones are characterized by high SiO2 (77.14% similar to 92.79%, average 84.14%), Al2O3 (3.86% similar to 14.15%, average 9.69%) content, low (Fe2O3T + MgO) * (0.98% similar to 3.20%, average 1.50%), TiO2 * (0.09% similar to 1.09%, average 0.39%) content, low Al2O3/SiO2 (0.04 similar to 0.18, average 0.12) and high K2O/Na2O (4.90 similar to 82.41, average 40.01) ratio, which is similar to the characteristic of passive continental margin. High field strength and large-ion lithophile elements contents in sediments from Xujiahe Formation are similar to that of the upper crust. Sigma REE contents of elastic rocks are 62 x 10(-6) similar to 495 x 10(-6) with an average of 181 x 10(-6), Sigma LREE/Sigma HREE ratios are 7.74 similar to 18.27 with an average of 13.51. As similar to upper crust REE pattern, chondrite-normalized REE patterns of samples show enrich LREE, flat HREE, moderate Eu (Eu/Eu* = 0.53 similar to 0.79, average 0.61) and Ce (Ce/Ce* = 0.55 similar to 1.09, average 0.79) negative anomalies. Part characteristic contents and ratios of trace and rare earth elements in sandstones, such as; Th, La, Ce, Rb/Sr, Th/U and La/Sc, hinted that the tectonic background were passive and active continental margin. Compositional variation index ICY (0.18 similar to 0.68, average 0.45) implied the source material were mainly recycled sediments. Sediment recirculation could cause clay minerals increased, then make CIA (chemical weathering index) accumulated. The value of CIA (72.10 similar to 96.28, average 81.18) demonstrated that these sediments accumulatively experienced intense chemical weathering. Meanwhile, strong negative correlation between CIA and ICY indicated that the variation of CIA is mainly caused by elastic input with different composition during sedimentary period. In combination with provenance, tectonic discrimination diagrams, these characteristics all above suggested Xujiahe Formation deposited under tectonic settings of passive (main setting) and active continental margin, and its provenances were from Xuefeng paleo-uplift area (main source) and Qinling orogenic belt.</td>

   <br>The Araba Complex is bounded by two major erosional unconformities, the newly defined Ediacaran Araba Unconformity (ca. 605 Ma) at its base, underlain by the Aqaba Complex, and the post-extensional, regional lower Cambrian Ram Unconformity (ca. 530 Ma) that is marked by the widespread deposition of thick alluvial and marginal-marine siliciclastics (Ram Group).
   <br>Two sub-cycles can be recognised in the Araba Complex mega-cycle. The earliest (Safi Group) followed suturing and extensional rifting of the Aqaba Complex that resulted in rapid basinal subsidence and the deposition of coarse-grained, polymict conglomerates (Saramuj Formation) in predominantly proximal, but evolving to more distal, alluvial fan settings. The early extensional basin appears to have been orientated approximately north-south (depocentre to the west) and can be traced from north Sinai to Lebanon, approximately parallel to the presentday Dead Sea Transform. Rounded clasts, up to boulder-size, include a variety of local to regionally-derived basement lithologies, including granites, diorites, metamorphic rocks; doleritic and rhyolitic dyke rocks. Rapid isostatic uplift and weathering of the granitoid basement resulted in high sediment flux that kept pace with rapid basin subsidence; this, in turn, led to erosion and partial peneplanation of the hinterland ANS. Regional detrital zircon ages from the conglomerate clasts and matrix indicate age ranges from ca. 650 to 600 Ma with a minor cluster between 750 to 700 Ma, indicating mostly a local or, at least, near-field provenance. Subsequent to this early, rapid basin-fill, continued crustal extension resulted in tapping of rhyolitic and basaltic effusive volcanics and volcaniclastics (Haiyala Volcaniclastics and Museimir Effusives, ca. 598-595 Ma), including flow-banded rhyolitic lavas and air-fall tuffs, the latter deposited in a lacustrine or shallow-water environments.
   <br>The second Araba sub-cycle (595-586 Ma) is characterised by renewed basinal subsidence, very low burial metamorphism to about 6 km depth, and associated stock-like intrusion of the Qunaia Monzogabbro (595 +/- 2 Ma) that resulted in thermal contact metamorphism of the Saramuj conglomerate, as well as granite plutons (e.g. Feinan-Humrat intrusions) and dolerite dykes. The second cycle is characterised by renewed extension, rifting and the deposition of volcanic rocks, agglomerates (Aheimir Volcanics) and monomict conglomerates (Umm Ghaddah Formation) that were sourced, locally, from volcanic rocks on the rift margins.
   <br>To the east, in the sub-surface of south-central Jordan, the early Safi sub-cycle is absent. Deep exploration wells and seismic data in the Jafr area demonstrate that the Araba Complex comprises terrestrial lavas (Ma'an Formation) with weathered soil horizons, unconformably overlying weathered Aqaba Complex granitic basement (Araba Unconformity). Seismic data in the Jafr region records the eruption of lavas in north-south trending graben and half-graben settings, and possible northwest-trending bounding faults similar to the Najd basins in Saudi Arabia. Again, in contrast to the outcrop areas to the west, the upper part of the Araba Complex, hereabouts, consists of fine-grained, in part carbonate-cemented sandstone and claystone, together with anhydrite (Jafr Formation) suggesting a shallow-marine or coastal sabkha setting, and a possible link to similar shallowmarine extensional basin-fills that developed widely within NW-trending Najd basins across the ANS in Saudi Arabia (e.g. Jibalah and Antaq basins). To date, no Ediacaran biotas have been described from the Araba Complex, but the Jafr Formation, which post-dates the appearance of soft-bodied faunas around 579 Ma, and which was probably deposited in marginal-marine environments, is a potential candidate for these enigmatic fossils.
   <br>Subsequent to the final Araba extensional rifting phase, renewed regional uplift, far to the south, of the ANS hinterland during the early Cambrian, led to widespread deposition of alluvial and shallow-marine siliciclastics as a progradational 'sand-sea' (Ram Group) that blanketed the now peneplained Aqaba Complex in south Jordan and surrounding countries (Ram Unconformity). However, the younger Ediacaran Araba Complex outcrops adjacent to Wadi Araba remained, in places, as a relatively immature palaeotopography. It was not until early mid-Cambrian times (ca. 509 Ma), during the Bull marine transgression that this late Ediacaran palaeotopography was finally buried.
   <br>The Araba Complex in Jordan with its multi-cycle development provides an insight to the regional development of Ediacaran extensional basins in the Arabian-Nubian Shield, an important phase in the evolution and transition from Neoproterozoic to Phanerozoic crustal tectonics and associated basin-fill.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Three outstanding questions regarding Paleoproterozoic crustal growth and assembly in southwestern Laurentia are (1) the mechanisms of crustal growth (back-arc rifting and associated juvenile magmatism vs. accretion of juvenile arcs), (2) the nature and significance of pre-Yavapai orogeny (&gt;1.70 Ga) deformation, and (3) how the isotopically mixed boundary zone between the Mojave and Yavapai Paleoproterozoic crustal provinces formed. Supracrustal successions associated with the Mojave-Yavapai boundary zone in northwestern Arizona are dominated by &gt;1730 Ma bimodal metavolcanic sequences and compositionally siliciclastic metasedimentary rocks, with minor ultramafic rocks, chert, and carbonate. This lithologic assemblage requires juvenile mafic volcanism in a basin that also received abundant quartz-rich (i.e., continental) detritus. A pre-D-1 (first deformational event), back-arc rift setting for northwestern Arizona best explains the observed supracrustal assemblage. Plutonic rocks that intrude the supracrustal rocks are generally 5-15 m.yr. younger and span the entire compositional range of granitoids; i.e., they are not plutonic equivalents of the metavolcanic rocks. In the model presented here, supracrustal rocks were deposited in a back-arc basin above an east-dipping subduction zone undergoing slab rollback. Subsequent shallowing of the subducting slab resulted in (1) eastward migration of 1.76-1.74 Ga arc magmatism in eastern California to 1.73-1.71 Ga arc magmatism within the former back-arc basin in northwestern Arizona, (2) consequent closure of the back-arc basin, (3) thrusting of Yavapai province rocks over the basin (D-1), resulting in (4) burial of supracrustal rocks to &gt;20 km, and ultimately, (5) gravitational collapse of the orogen. These events predated the 1.70-1.68 Ga Yavapai orogeny and occurred within a time interval of 5-20 m.yr. Similar time intervals for tectonic switching have been documented from the Lachlan orogen of eastern Australia. Rifting and associated magmatism and arc accretion are both viableand not mutually exclusivemechanisms for crustal growth.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe (SHRIMP) U-Pb zircon age dating was applied to several types of cordierite-bearing gneisses and orthopyroxene-bearing gneiss from the basement rocks in central Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica, to clarify the timing of tectonothermal events during the amalgamation of East and West Gondwana. The zircon ages of ca. 522-525 and 598-599 Ma were obtained in Filchnerfjella and Hochlinfjellet, respectively, and the cathodoluminescence images of analyzed zircons suggest that these were formed during high-temperature metamorphism. These two sets of ages are interpreted to represent periods that immediately followed the peak metamorphism. The dating results reveal an age gap of 80 Myr between the two areas, indicating different collisional events. In the cordierite-bearing samples in Filchnerfjella, zircon cores with oscillatory zoning have concordia ages that range from 1800 to 650 Ma. These are considered to represent the ages of detrital zircons derived over a long time from different source materials. In Hochlinfjellet, the inherited detrital zircons with oscillatory zoning have concordia ages of ca. 930, 780, and 730 Ma, indicating sedimentary protoliths derived from differently aged igneous source rocks, possibly formed in a subduction zone as an accretionary prism before the collision. According to previous age results, previously documented shear zones are now interpreted as representing a major tectonic boundary. The obtained age results imply that different allochthonous metamorphic terranes were assembled along the collisional zone of the East African-Antarctica Orogen during the period from 650 to 500 Ma.</td>

In the northern sector of the central Southern Alps the earliest stages of shortening resulted in the inversion of structures inherited from the Permian and Triassic rifting phases, together with southward thrusting and large-scale folding. In the San Marco Pass area (N Italy) the Variscan basement overrides the Permian-Triassic sedimentary cover along regional thrusts. Here the E-W trending Orobic Thrust joins the NE-SE Porcile Thrust. Initial thrusting phases formed greenschist facies mylonites in the basement and S-verging folds in the sedimentary covers. The Porcile line, a feature likely inherited from the Permian extension, was re-activated as a steep mylonite shear zone. Fault activity continued at brittle conditions: cataclastic shear zones overprinted the mylonites. During this phase, shortening was preferentially accommodated along the Orobic Thrust. A final transpressive re-activation observed along both thrusts is linked to the Oligocene activity of the Insubric Fault.</td>

Our map, at the 1: 20,000 scale, describes the tectono-stratigraphic evolution of this sector that resulted from multistage faulting along that fault zone. Four main tectonic stages are defined on the basis of the crosscutting relationships between mapped faults and stratigraphic unconformities: late Priabonian-Rupelian, Chattian-early Miocene, late Serravallian-Tortonian, and late Messinian-early Pliocene. Our results demonstrate that since the late Burdigalian, the Villalvernia-Varzi Line was sealed by the gravitational emplacement of a chaotic rock body. The deposition of the late Serravallian-early Messinian succession is controlled by NW-striking strike-slip faults that crosscut to the west the Villalvernia-Varzi Line. Extensional tectonics related to regional scale N-dipping tilting characterized the late Messinian-early Pliocene time interval.</td>

The NW-SE-oriented Tellaro River Valley marks the transition between the eastern (Siracusa Plateau) and western (Ragusa Plateau) domains of the foreland, where a post-Tortonian structural depression, here designated as Tellaro Basin, originated. The map pictures the geometry and kinematics of the border faults and the structure affecting the basin infilling. The mapped structural pattern denounces a poliphase tectonic evolution of the region, suggesting the occurrence of a major NW-SE-oriented crustal discontinuity that, being active during the different periods of the post-Tortonian evolution of the area, could play a primary role also in the present seismotectonic picture.</td>

These three units are from top to bottom: the Stilo Unit, the Aspromonte-Peloritani Unit (APU) and the Madonna di Polsi Unit. As part of an ongoing project, we have constructed a structural and metamorphic GIS database based on 285 sampling stations, which allows for metamorphic and structural maps to be obtained in the form of the metamorphic zoning of the SU.. This unit, made up of low greenschist- to low amphibolite-facies Palaeozoic metamorphic rocks, lies through a brittle tectonic contact over the APU, which is made up of amphibolite-facies metamorphic rocks intruded by late Hercynian peraluminous both locally overprinted by Alpine type metamorphism. The petrographic-derived metamorphic zonation chart here presented has been created after the detailed petrographic analysis of about 80 thin sections and the recognition of mineral assemblages of a thermal metamorphic aureole (biotite, muscovite and andalusite blastesis) produced by Late Hercynian magmatic bodies intruded into metapelites (Punta d'Ato granitoids, outcropping in the northern part of the mapped area).</td>

The exposed successions of the study area have been investigated by structural analyses, petrographic, petrological and geochemical studies whose results are summarised in the geological map.
   <br>In this area, two HP-LT metamorphic, oceanic-derived units, referred as the Mongrassano and Cozzo Cervello units, have been distinguished on the base of their stratigraphic and tectono-metamorphic evolution. Both the oceanic-derived units show a polyphase deformation history developed under retrograde metamorphism in a subduction zone by underplating and exhumation into an accretionary wedge. These units are overthrust by continental-derived units, referred as the Sila and Castagna units, consisting of medium and high-grade metamorphic rocks. While the Castagna unit displays an Alpine HP/LT metamorphic overprint, the Sila unit escaped any subduction-related metamorphism.</td>

The 1: 10,000 scale geological map is located in the southern portion of the massif, where serpentinite is in contact with ophiolitic rocks pertaining to the Piemonte Zone, which represents the fossil Mesozoic Tethyan ocean. Southwards, ophiolites are overthrusted by the continental-derived Austroalpine Mont Glacier unit. Serpentinite consists of antigorite, magnetite, and coarse grained Ti-clinohumite, olivine, and diopside, which are reminiscent of the original mantle texture. Rodingitic mafic dykes are intruded within serpentinite; other mafic rocks, consisting of (not rodingitized) metagabbro and metabasalt with relict eclogitic minerals, occur as tectonic slices associated with serpentinite, calcschist and sulphide-rich epidosite. The map gives detailed and updated information on the structure and lithostratigraphy of the Mount Avic ophiolites, providing an insight to the mantle-crust transition of the Tethyan oceanic lithosphere.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The presented maps provide an example of the synoptic display of multi-scale geological features characterizing the tectono-metamorphic evolution of the crystalline basement terranes in a poly-orogenic-multistadial evolutionary scenario. The petro-structural map of the eastern Aspromonte Massif (southern Calabrian Peloritani Orogen) is characterized by a nappe-like edifice composed by the superimposition of three crystalline basement tectonic units which, sharing the same Alpine-Apennine reworking, underwent a different metamorphic evolution, mostly derived from the Hercynian orogenic cycle. This geological framework is completed by the suture deposition of a Oligocene-Miocene syn-orogenic clastic formation, partly roofed by the back-thrusting of a clay-rich melange. In order to understand the potential relationships within the complex dataset deriving from the geological investigations of this crystalline basement area, a geo-database, capable of handling multi-scale information from field-derived structural data (i.e. foliation, lineation, fold-and fault-related structures) to micro-scale derived ones (i.e. thin-section analysis, electron microscope and microprobe investigations, thermodynamic modeling outputs) has been constructed, according to the international standards using the Geo-Scientific Markup Language developed by the Commission for the Management and Application of Geo-science Information. Proposed outputs will show the relationships between field-related geological features, showing collected samples and the subsequent laboratory investigations. These are fundamental to achieving reliable results in geological contexts, such as those for reconstructing the tectono-metamorphic evolution of crystalline basement terrains.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Jiamusi massif is a major tectonic unit in the eastern part of NE China and composed chiefly of the Early Paleozoic (about 500 Ma) metamorphosed crystalline basement containing Precambrian, even Archean crust and three suites of unmetamorphosed continental marginal sedimentary formations of the Devonian-Lower Carboniferous, the Late Carboniferous-Permian and the Late Triassic, which are similar to those in the Bureya and Khanka massifs in Russia. In the Devonian-Lower Carboniferous, the microcontinent consisting of the Jiamusi and Songnen massifs in China and the Bureya and Khanka massifs in Russia evolved independently, the eastern part of which was a passive continental margin, where a suite of the marine sedimentary-volcanic formation is overlain unconformably on the crystalline basement. The regional stratigraphic break in the middle Carboniferous in the whole northeastern China was related to the collision of the microcontinent with the Argun-Hinggan microcontinent in the west, indicating the formation of a new amalgamated continent (Heilongjiang plate). Therefore, the Late Carboniferous-Permian volcanic-sedimentary formation is the first unitary cover on the Heilongjiang plate. The Late Carboniferous-Permian and the Late Triassic sedimentary formations in the eastern part of the Jiamusi-Bureya-Khanka microcontinent represent the evolutional features of the eastern continental margin of the Heilongjiang plate. Summarily, the eastern margin of the Heilongjiang plate mainly suffered the following evolution stages from the Late Carboniferous to the Late Triassic: (1) the transform or passive continental margin in the Late Carboniferous, characterized by terrestrial facies clastic rocks with interbeded recoverable coal layers; (2) the active continental margin in the Permian marked by the magmatic arc composed mainly of intermediate-acid volcanics and granites; (3) the transform margin in the Early-Middle Triassic indicated by the simultaneous stratigraphic break, and (4) the passive continental margin in the Late Triassic characterized by the marine-terrigenous facies sedimentary formation.</td>

The petrological similarity of the rocks from the central and northern chains of the Kuril island arc testifies that they were formed above "hot" geochemically enriched but isotopically depleted lithospheric mantle. The compositional change of the volcanic rocks of Matua Island in the Pleistocene-Holocene suggests a geodynamic transition at that time. Taking into account the similar tendency previously established in the southern Kuril Range (Kunashir Island) and for the Mutnovsky and Gorelyi volcanoes of southern Kamchatka, a global Pleistocene-Holocene tectonic event may be proposed in the evolution of the Kuril-Kamchatka island arc. The finding of the "adakite-like" tephra on Matua Island indicates the presence of felsic adakite-like melts among the eruption products of Sarychev Peak Volcano.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Subduction generated a NW-trending Andean arc along the Californian margin beginning at similar to 175 Ma. Coeval high-pressure (HP) transformation of oceanic crust in an east-dipping, subduction zone probably accompanied plate convergence, but recovered Franciscan eclogite and garnet blueschist blocks chiefly possess younger recrystallization ages of similar to 165-150 Ma. These Jurassic HP metamafic rocks were sequestered in a low-temperature environment well into Cretaceous time. Fragments of actinolitic rinds partially surround many such high-grade blocks. Only slightly younger than the HP metamorphism, these rinds reflect metasomatic exchange between metabasalt and serpentinized harzburgite along the dynamic oceanic crust-mantle hanging wall during storage of the mafic rocks at moderate depth. High-grade tectonic blocks later were brought toward the surface in circulating, low-density, sheared mud-matrix melange and/or in buoyant serpentinite bodies. Most exotic HP metamafic blocks occur in melanges of the Franciscan Central Belt, reflecting tectonic insertion within the subduction zone not near-surface additions to the clastic section. However, rare, high-grade clasts in feebly recrystallized Franciscan conglomerates suggest erosion and sedimentary deposition for some HP blocks. The addition of dense metabasaltic olistoliths to the mid-and Upper Cretaceous section requires that these HP material were carried surfaceward first as tectonic fragments, perhaps immersed in low-density serpentinite or mud-matrix melange, then eroded and transported into the trench. HP rocks are conspicuously lacking in coeval Great Valley strata. Whatever the origin of particular high-grade rocks, widespread post-depositional shearing has largely obliterated their original natures, but all dense metamafic blocks of Jurassic recrystallization age must have been supplied to the Cretaceous Franciscan accretionary complex by entrainment in a low-density, circulating muddy matrix or serpentinite body. The vast majority of exotic HP blocks resides in Central Belt melanges, and appears to be tectonic rather than olistostromal in origin.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Subduction of rocks into the mantle results in high-pressure metamorphism and the formation of eclogites from basaltic precursor rocks. In general, many kilometers of oceanic lithosphere are ultimately consumed prior to the subsequent continental slab subduction and collision. The exposure of the eclogites derived from oceanic subduction and continental subduction at the surface of Earth today record provide different P-T-t records of the subduction process. The Huwan shear zone in the Hong' an orogenic belt, marking a former ocean-continent transition zone, has been the focus of many studies on subduction-related high-pressure metamorphism. In this study, Lu-Hf garnet, U-Pb zircon, and Ar-Ar mica ages are combined with geochemical data to understand the origin of two coexisting eclogite bodies exposed along the Xuehe River in the Huwan Shear zone. In total, the results indicate that the two eclogites have different protoliths but experienced a similar metamorphic history. This observation requires new tectonic model for the coupled subduction of oceanic and continental crust in subduction zones. Combined geochemistry and zircon U-Pb geochronology suggest distinct oceanic and continental affinities for the eclogite protoliths. The Lu-Hf dates of 261.5 +/- 2.4 Ma of the continental-type eclogite and 262.7 +/- 1.7 Ma of the oceanic-type eclogite reflect garnet growth and are interpreted to closely approximate the age of eclogite-facies metamorphism. Therefore, both the geochemically oceanic-and continental-type eclogites underwent the same episode of Permian eclogite-facies metamorphism. The Permian Lu-Hf ages of ca. 262 Ma and the obtained Triassic Ar-Ar ages (similar to 240 Ma) of the oceanic-type and continental-type eclogites imply coupled subduction and exhumation of oceanic and continental crustal materials in the Hong'an orogenic belt during the Permian and the Triassic. Though limited, the geochemical and geochronological results of this study, together with the discrepant Carboniferous dates for the nearby eclogites of previous studies, apparently suggest that the Huwan shear zone was not always a single coherent unit but instead comprises different tectonic slices that were metamorphosed at different times before final assembly. Some slices of the oceanic and continental crust underwent two subduction cycles during the Carboniferous and the Permian, whereas some eclogites registered only a single subduction-exhumation loop during the convergence between the South China Block and the North China Block in the Huwan shear zone. The consistent ages of the oceanic-and continental-type eclogites disfavor the traditional melange model that high-pressure rocks are dismembered fragments that have been assembled and intercalated with rocks devoid of any high-pressure history at shallow crustal levels, forming a tectonic melange.</td>

Therefore a 200 in thick section in the type locality of the Schrambach Formation, situated south of Salzburg, is documented in this study. The studied sequence in the Schrambachgraben seems to be in the prevailing part of section in simple, monoclinal mode of deposition. The opposite is true. The section studied begins with the Oberalm Formation, passes gradually into the Schrambach Formation and ends with the lower part of the Rossfeld Formation. According to our detail results, deposits of the Schrambach Formation in this type of section occur in a minimum of three tectonic slices. The first tectonic slice is composed of a transitional sequence of the Obera lm Formation to the Schrambach Formation. The uppermost part of the Oberalin Formation is dated as the Middle Berriasian Calpionella Zone (Elliptica Subzone). According to calcareous dinoflagellates, the lower part of the stratal sequence of the Schrambach Formation belongs to the Fusca Acme Zone, which corresponds to the early part of the Late Berriasian. According to the occurrence of the calpionellids Calpionellites one mob, Cts. durderi and Cts. major, the second slice belongs to the Early Valanginian. With respect to occurrences of ammonites and non-calcareous dinotlagellates findings, the tectonic slice belongs to the higher Late.Berriasian Subthurmannia boissieri ammonite Zone. The Early Valanginian age of the uppermost accessible part of the section is indicated by sporadic findings of Calpionellites darderi and Cts. major and ammonite Thurmanniceras pertransiens. A new genus. Schrambachoceras gen. nov., and a new species, Schrambachoceras weidichi sp. nov., were identified. The basal part of the Rossfeld Formation contains ammonites and non-calcareous dinoflagellates of Late Valanginian age (Neocomites peregrinus ammonite Zone).</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Mongolia arc structural belt has a complicated formation and development history. It is an important boundary that affect the internal tectonic deformation and evolution of China mainland. From the gravity anomalies to study the crustal deformation patterns, to further reveal the continental crust and lithospheric mantle deformation characteristics in the northern part of China, has an important geological and geophysical significance.
   <br>In order to study the density structures of sources at different depths, we need to separate the gravity anomalies and understand tectonic deformation patterns from the field sources of different depths. First, on the basis of the EGM2008 model, we have the free air gravity anomalies, using the gravity correction approach, calculated Bouguer and Airy gravity anomalies in the Mongolia and its surrounding areas. Then, introduce the Crust 1. 0 crustal model, and establish the reference density model from the surface to the 55 km depth in Mongolia and its surrounding areas. Finally, we extract 6 profiles and determine the hierarchical gravity anomalies in each profile, and make the quantitative analysis on gravity anomaly features of the crust-lithospheric mantle density field source bodies of in Mongolia and its surrounding areas.
   <br>On the basis of above data and methods, our results include: (1) The gravity anomaly models in Mongolia and its surrounding areas indicate the obvious differences of tectonic deformation between the Hangai dome and Altay Mountains in the western region. There is no area with apparent high-value isostatic gravity anomalies in the Hangai dome. But the high-value regions are concentrated in the southwest of the Altay Mountains. We infer that this feature is related to the new tectonic movement. (2)Based on the reference crustal density model by Crust 1. 0, we have investigated the distributions of lateral inhomogeneous bodies in the crust and upper mantle, and find the lateral density structure is important to forward modeling of the gravityanomalies caused by the Moho relief. (3)We have the comprehensive profiles with density structure from the Crust 1. 0 model. The results indicate that the density feature is consistent with deep crustal deformation and structures of large active faults.
   <br>From the analysis of the hierarchical gravity anomalies and the reference density models, we suggest a dynamic model that accounts for the deep crustal movement from west to east in Mongolia, in which the force source is not from the squeeze process between the Siberian plate and Eurasian plate, rather related to the northeastward movement of the block in the southwestern Altay Mountains. The formation of strike-slip faults in both north and south of the Hangai Dome is also related to this movement. The deformed interface determined by the Crust 1. 0 model is consistent with the distribution of surface ruptures. There is the correlation between the topography and deep deformation, which consists with the isostatic hypothesis. Therefore, it is a feasible approach to improve gravity inversion using Bouguer gravity anomalies based on the lateral inhomogeneous density model in regions with complex structures. Our results also indicate that the consistency between deep and shallow mass distribution and deformation in the arc-like tectonic deformation zone of Mongolia.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>After the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, several groups did some researches on the Cenozoic exhumation history of the Longmenshan range. However, to the east of the Pengguan massif, the thermochronology data are still scarce and the exhumation history is unknown, as the previous researches mainly focus on the Pengguan massif. The research on the exhumation history of the rocks to the east of the Pengguan massif can not only help to understand the Cenozoic faulting histories of the faults at the Longmenshan Thrust Belt, but also make significant constraints on the uplift mechanism of the eastern margin of the Tibetan plateau.
   <br>We add some fission track samples along the Beichuan-Yingxiu fault and the Jiangyou-Guanxian fault, on the basis of previous studies. The samples are dated at the Fission Track Lab of the National Chung Cheng University, with the external detector method.
   <br>We get 6 Zircon Fission Track (ZFT) data and 6 Apatite Fission Track (AFT) data. At the hanging wall of the Jiangyou-Guanxian fault, the AFT data show significant difference divided by the Xiaoyudong fault. To the south of the Xiaoyudong fault, the AFT age is 39 Ma, while the ages are between 6-8 Ma to the north.
   <br>The research reveals that the vertical activities of the Beichuan-Yingxiu fault and the Jiangyou-Guanxian fault since 8 Ma are much different separated by the Xiaoyudong fault; north to the Xiaoyudong fault, the average vertical slip rate along the Beichuan-Yingxiu fault and the Jiangyou-Guanxian fault is about 0. 1 mm . a(-1) and about 0. 55 mm . a(-1), respectively; south to the Xiaoyudong fault, the average vertical slip rate along the Beichuan-Yingxiu fault and Jiangyou-Guanxian fault is about 0. 55 mm . a(-1) and about 0. 1 mm . a(-1), respectively. The late-Cenozoic vertical slip rate of the faults revealed by the thermochronology data is coincided with the co-seismic vertical displacement of the Wenchuan earthquake. The horizontal shortening across the Jiangyou-Guanxian fault (north to the Xiaoyudong fault) reaches 8 12 km since 8 Ma, which indicates that the crustal shortening performing as the thrust movement along the main faults is the one of the main causes for the uplift and exhumation of the Longmenshan range. Our results don't support the lower crust thickening model for the uplift of the Longmenshan range.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>A layer of Mesoproterozoic tsunami deposits from the North China Craton was recently discovered and investigated in the Xingcheng area, Liaoning Province, China. They occur at the bottom of the Dahongyu Formation of the Changcheng Group (1.8-1.6Ga). The tsunami deposits are identified based on the analysis of the sedimentary facies. They are markedly different from the normal deposits of shore-shallow sea siliciclastics, and are characterized by rip-up clasts, poorly sorted gravels, fining-upward sequences, redeposited underlying materials, complex sources of underlying strata and erosional bases at the bottom of beds. They are compelling features of tsunamiites when they occur together. During the Mesoproterozoic, the Xingcheng area was in an active tectonic belt, the Yanshan Taphrogenic Trough. The origin of the tsunami was probably triggered by the earthquake, which resulted from the the activities of the Luanxian-Jianchang Fault in early Mesoproterozoic times. The deposition of tsunamiites occurred in a coastal environment and involved several stages, from the origin, propagation, inundation, and deposition to the backwash flow. The geodynamic backgrounds of the tsunami event in the North China Craton are consistent with the breakup event of the Columbia supercontinent in the Mesoproterozoic. Some events, such as tsunamis and volcanism, are all controlled by extensional rift systems and should be recognized as effects of the breakup of the Columbia supercontinent in the North China Craton.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The sequence architecture and depositional systems of the Paleogene lacustrine rift succession in the Huanghekou Sag, Bohai Bay Basin, NE China were investigated based on seismic profiles, combined with well log and core data. Four second-order or composite sequences and seven third-order sequences were identified. The depositional systems identified in the basin include: fan delta, braid delta, meander fluvial delta, lacustrine and sublacustrine fan. Identification of the slope break was conducted combining the interpretation of faults of each sequence and the identification of syndepositional faults, based on the subdivision of sequence stratigraphy and analysis of depositional systems. Multiple geomorphologic units were recognized in the Paleogene of the Huanghekou Sag including faults, flexures, depositional slope break belts, ditch-valleys and sub-uplifts in the central sag. Using genetic division principles and taking into consideration tectonic features of the Paleogene of the Huanghekou Sag, the study area was divided into the Northern Steep Slope/Fault Slope Break System, the Southern Gentle Slope Break System and T10 Tectonic Slope Break System/T10 Tectonic Belt. Responses of slope break systems to deposition-erosion are shown as: (1) basin marginal slope break is the boundary of the eroded area and provenance area; (2) ditch-valley formed by different kinds of slope break belts is a good transport bypass for source materials; (3) shape of the slope break belt of the slope break system controls sediments types; (4) the ditch-valley and sub-sag of a slope break system is an unloading area for sediments; and (5) due to their different origins, association characteristics and developing patterns, the Paleogene slope break belt systems in the Huanghekou Sag show different controls on depositional systems. The Northern Fault Slope Break system controls the deposition of a fan delta-lacustrine-subaqueous fan, the Southern Gentle Slope Break system controls the deposition of a fluvial-deltaic-shallow lacustrine and sublacustrine fan, and the T10 Tectonic Slope Break System controls the deposition of shallow lacustrine beach bar sandbodies. The existence of a slope break system is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for studying sandbody development. The formation of effective sandbodies along the slope break depends on the reasonable coupling of effective provenance, necessary association patterns of slope break belt, adequate unloading space and creation of definite accommodation space.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The paper is focused on the two tectonic-geodynamic factors that made the most appreciable contribution to the transformation of the lithospheric and hydrocarbon potential distribution at the Barents Sea continental margin: Jurassic-Cretaceous basaltic magmatism and the Cenozoic tectonic deformations. The manifestations of Jurassic-Cretaceous basaltic magmatism in the sedimentary cover of the Barents Sea continental margin have been recorded using geological and geophysical techniques. Anomalous seismic units related to basaltic sills hosted in terrigenous sequences are traced in plan view as a tongue from Franz Josef Land Archipelago far to the south along the East Barents Trough System close to its depocentral zone with the transformed thinned Earth's crust. The Barents Sea igneous province has been contoured. The results of seismic stratigraphy analysis and timing of basaltic rock occurrences indicate with a high probability that the local structures of the hydrocarbon (HC) fields and the Stockman-Lunin Saddle proper were formed and grew almost synchronously with intrusive magmatic activity. The second, no less significant multitectonic stress factor is largely related to the Cenozoic stage of evolution, when the development of oceanic basins was inseparably linked with the Barents Sea margin. The petrophysical properties of rocks from the insular and continental peripheries of the Barents Sea shelf are substantially distinct as evidence for intensification of tectonic processes in the northwestern margin segment. These distinctions are directly reflected in HC potential distribution.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Geological and geophysical data on the Central Atlantic are discussed in order to elucidate the tectonic setting of the initial magmatic activity, rifting, and breakup resulting in the origination of Mesozoic ocean. The structural, magmatic, and historical aspects of the problem are considered. It has been established that the initial dispersed rifting and low-capacity magmatism at proximal margins was followed by the migration of the process toward the central part of region with the formation of distal zones and the development of vigorous magmmatism, further breakup of the lithosphere and ocean opening. Magmatism, its sources, and the features of newly formed magmatic crust at both the rifting and breakup stages of margin development are discussed and compared with subsequent spreading magmatism. Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopic compositions show that the magmatic evolution of the Central Atlantic proximal margins bears the features of two enriched components, one of which is related to the EM-1 source, developing only at the North American margin. Another enriched component typical of the province as a whole is related to the EM-2 source. To a lesser extent, this component is expressed in igneous rocks of Guyana, which also bear the signature of the MORB-type depleted source typical of spreading tholeiites in the Atlantic Ocean. Similar conditions are assumed for subsequent magmatism at the distal margins and for the early spreading basalts in the adjacent Atlantic belt, which also contain a small admixture of enriched material. A comparison of the magmatism at the margins of Central and North Atlantic reveals their specificity distinctly expressed in isotopic compositions of igneous rocks. In contrast to the typical region of the North Atlantic, the immediate melting of the enriched lithospheric source without the participation of plume-related melts is reconstructed for the proximal margins of the Central Atlantic. At the same time, decompression and melting in the lithosphere could have been determined by the thermal effect of the Central Atlantic hot plume. This is testified by the intense melting in a short time interval over a vast area; the generation of rather homogeneous melts and creation of the thick magmatic crust; the radial arrangement of the dikes intruded in the course of plume ascent; as well as by the data of seismic tomography indicating the occurrence of the hot upper mantle material, which has kept the "memory" of the action of a shallow-seated Mesozoic plume. The formation of the Central Atlantic plume can be presumably regarded as a result of upwelling remobilisation adove the ancient African superplume and the rearrangement of the deep structure in Triassic and Jurassic times.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Covering a depth interval of 1200 m thirty-one rock samples were collected from a well drilled in the Beust Field of the Ibbenburen anthracite mine, Lower Saxony Basin, NW-Germany. These rock samples consist of high rank coals/anthracites, claystones, siltstones and sandstones of Pennsylvanian age. Analytical methods include the measurement of random vitrinite reflectance VRr, rotational reflectance VRrot as well as maximum and minimum reflectances VRmax and VRmin, enabling the evaluation of the lithological influence on vitrinite reflectance as well as the indication of tectonic stresses in the Lower Saxony Basin by applying the RIS (reflectance indicating surface) analysis method. This study shows that not only due to the high rank of the studied samples and associated anisotropic character but also due to lithological dependency a partially significant scatter of measured VRr can be observed. The scatter in coals is significantly less than in other sedimentary rocks, e.g., standard deviation in coals can be up to 7x less than in siltstones. The expected increase of standard deviation with increasing rank and accordant anisotropy was not observed for VRr but rather for VRmax with the exception of coals displaying a relatively constant and low deviation throughout the depth/maturity interval. Mean VRr values of coals differ from those of other sedimentary rocks at equal depths. VRr measured in claystones is consistently higher compared to associated coal seams and can be elevated by up to 10%. Silt- and sandstones always display lower VRr with differences of up to 16%.
   <br>At very high levels of thermal maturity, vitrinite reflectance depends not only on maximum paleotemperature but also on lithology leading to differences in pressure propagation and thus deformation. Additionally, radioactive trace elements in coals and organic matter-rich claystones provide a local secondary heat source. K-40 and Th-232 are preferentially bound to clay particles which are enriched in the studied claystones and depleted in the silt- and sandstones possibly leading to higher vitrinite reflectance observed in the claystones.
   <br>RIS analysis shows a predominantly negative biaxial distribution indicating the absence of thermal overprinting by a possible intrusion (Bramsche Massif) during the Late Cretaceous which would have induced a uniaxial distribution. Instead, this implies, in addition to vertical stresses due to depositional loading, the presence of a secondary stress field not perpendicular to bedding which is related to the inversion of the Lower Saxony Basin. This information presents, in combination with previous basin modeling results, additional evidence for deep subsidence with subsequent uplift being the cause for the present-day maturity patterns observed in the Lower Saxony Basin.

The importance of the chosen area mostly resided in the presence of really diffuse running-waters and gravity-induced landforms which strictly affect urban areas. The geomorphological processes are linked with the Quaternary tectonic uplift affecting the Apennine front-Bradanic foredeep sectors. Series of field surveys, supported by aerial photo-interpretation, have led to the production of a geomorphological map at 1: 16,000 scale which outlines the main processes and related landforms recognized in the study area. The latter are the result of the complex interplay of structural, gravitational and fluvial processes. Particular attention was devoted to the recognition, identification and mapping of landslides which affect the slope of the main villages (Craco and Pisticci), locally giving rise to hazardous conditions.</td>

The Monte Grighini Complex is a NW-SE trending metamorphic complex made up of three tectonic units and synkinematic magmatic intrusions that show a section of the deepest portion of the Nappe zone. The tectonic units stacked and folded under lower greenschist and upper amphibolite facies conditions, were finally juxtaposed by a kilometer-wide NW-SE trending dextral transtensive shear zone during the Late Variscan tectonics. The 1: 25,000 scale geological map, cross sections and shear zone deformation map illustrate the tectonic and metamorphic setting of the area, resulting from the polyphasic Variscan collisional evolution including early nappe stacking and later strike slip and extensional tectonics coeval with a late Carboniferous magmatism. Deformation structures and metamorphic assemblages recorded by the tectonic units as well as synkinematic intrusions, provide constraints of fundamental importance for the reconstruction of southern Variscan chain tectono-metamorphic history.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This work presents a geomorphological map of the Feltrino Stream basin and minor surrounding coastal basins (scale 1: 20,000), located in the south-eastern Abruzzo area (Central Italy), across the Adriatic piedmont of the Maiella massif (Central Apennines). This geomorphological mapping is focused on near-surface deposits and hillslope evolution analysis and includes three sections: main geomorphological map; orography and hydrography; and geomorphological models of hillslope evolution.
   <br>In the study area, landforms and continental near-surface deposits are mainly linked to slope and fluvial processes, even though structural, marine, and anthropogenic landforms are also present. The mapping is primarily focused on near-surface deposits and landforms related to the evolution of hillslopes, resulting from the combination of tectonic (regional uplift) and surface processes. At a local scale, it can contribute to an understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and consequences of the changes of landforms and hillslopes and help solve engineering geomorphological problems. Finally, it is also a tool for the assessment of geomorphological hazards in landscapes characterized by widespread near-surface deposits and intense and rapid geomorphological processes, as well as a tool for land management.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This paper reports an integrated, spatio-temporal analysis of the fracture-controlled paleo-fluid system in the Pico del Aguila anticline, a N-S trending fold located in the Sierras Exteriores, the southern front of the Spanish Pyrenees. Eight fracture sets (joints or faults) are recognized throughout the fold and are separated into a fracture sequence that is defined using field relationships and the remarkable temporal constraints offered by the syn-tectonic sedimentary deposits. This fracture sequence records a complex Paleocene to Early Oligocene structural evolution, including map-view, clockwise rotation and tilting of the fold axis. The geochemical analysis of calcite cements from the different mineralized fracture/vein sets reveals a compartmentalized fluid system during most of fold development. This initial paleofluid system was later perturbed when bending-related fractures associated with foreland flexure and outer arc extension triggered small-scale, vertical fluid migration. Fractures developed in shallow strata facilitated downward migration of surficial fluids that controlled the paleo-fluid system in the Late Priabonian/Stampian continental deposits. The study of the Pico del Aguila anticline depicts for the first time the evolution of a fluid system in a shallow, syn-depositional compressional setting, and results further strengthen the statement that fluids migrate vertically across stratigraphic boundaries take place during fold hinge-related deformation.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Many rift zones exhibit a range of fault orientations, rather than simple colinear faults that strike orthogonal to the inferred least principal stress. The formation of non-colinear fault sets has implications for assessing rift-zone kinematics, as well as determining palaeo-stress state in extensional basins. Using 3D seismic reflection data, we deduce the likely mechanisms responsible for the formation of a population of non-colinear faults in the Maloy Slope area of the northern North Sea. Three basement-displacing fault populations exist on the Maley Slope; (i) large (&gt;1 km throw), N-S-striking faults, (ii) smaller (&lt;250 m throw) N-S-striking faults and (iii) small (&lt;250 m throw) NE-SW-striking faults. All were initiated in the Middle Jurassic. Coeval growth of these fault populations, and the apparent correlation between the NE SW faults and a NE-SW-trending gravity and magnetic anomaly high lead us to suggest that the NE SW faults are the result of deflection of the otherwise E-W-orientated least principal stress by NE-trending intrabasement weaknesses. Our study's results have implications for the large-scale kinematic evolution of the North Sea, arguing that major rotations in extension direction are not required to generate multiple fault sets locally or across the rift. This study also highlights the importance of using borehole-constrained 3D seismic data as a tool in understanding non-colinear fault growth, and its broader implications for regional tectonic history.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Namche Barwa Complex exposed in the Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis, south Tibet, underwent high-pressure (HP) and high-temperature (HT) granulite-facies metamorphism and associated anatexis. The HP pelitic granulites contain garnet, kyanite, sillimanite, cordierite, biotite, quartz, plagioclase, K-feldspar, spine!, ilmenite and graphite. These minerals show composite reaction texture and varying chemical compositions and form four successive mineral assemblages. Phase equilibrium modeling constrains the P-T conditions of 10-12 kbar and 550-700 degrees C for the prograde stage, 13-16 kbar and 840-880 degrees C for the peak-metamorphic stage, and 5-6 kbar and 830-870 degrees C for the late retrograde stage, indicating that the HP granulites recorded a clockwise P-T path involving the early heating burial and anatexis through dehydration melting of both muscovite and biotite, and the late isothermal decompression and gradual melt crystallization under HT granulite-facies conditions. The zircon U-Pb dating reveals that the HT granulite-facies metamorphism probably initiated at ca. 40 Ma, and lasted to ca. 8 Ma. Therefore, the present study provides robust evidence for a long-lived HT metamorphism and associated anatexis in the deeply buried Indian continent and important constraints on the leucogranite generation and tectonic evolution of the Himalayan orogen.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Uplift of the Tibetan Plateau and related crustal shortening are key issues in understanding collisional geodynamics, and magmatic rocks that formed in this compressional setting provide clues to the processes involved. Numerous granitic porphyry dikes have been identified in the Angsai area of the northern Qiangtang block in north-central Tibet. These dikes were emplaced along NW-SE-striking reverse faults that run parallel or sub-parallel to the thrust belt, suggesting that they are syn-collisional. New LA-ICP-MS zircon (206)pb/U-238 and magmatic biotite Ar-40/Ar-39 results demonstrate that the dikes crystallized at ca. 64 Ma, and the bulk geochemistry of the dikes shows that they are adakitic, with high Sr/Y and La/Yb ratios, and low Y and Yb contents. Their low MgO, Ni, and Cr contents, along with positive zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) and bulk epsilon(Nd)(t) values, suggest that the adakitic rocks were the result of partial melting of a juvenile thickened lower crust. Our new data indicate the uplift of north-central Tibet which started as early as 64 Ma. Synthesizing available geochronological, geochemical, and structural data, it seems that the crustal shortening and uplift of the plateau is a long-lived process consisting of a rapid early stage, and a slow and more constant later stage. Collision-related magmatic activity peaked at the time of transition between those two stages. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Abundant Jurassic bimodal igneous rocks are present in the Nanling region, southeastern China. Their relationship with the tectonic evolution of southeastern China in the Jurassic is still a matter of debate. The similar to 194 Ma Xialan gabbroic intrusion is the oldest mafic intrusion in the Jurassic Nanling igneous belt discovered to date. The intrusion also hosts a significant Fe-Ti oxide deposit Thus, this intrusion is important for the studies of fundamental controls on the early Jurassic basaltic magmatism in the region and on the Fe-Ti oxide mineralization in this type of intrusion. In this paper we report Hf-O isotopic compositions of zircon for the intrusion and the stratigraphic variations of whole-rock and important mineral compositions in the intrusion. Based on variations in mineral assemblages and the compositions of cumulus minerals, the Xialan intrusion is divided into four cyclic units (I to IV from the base to the top). Our results indicate that each unit represents a new input of magma with composition more primitive than the resident magma. The contents of Fo in olivine, which occurs in the base of Units land II, are similar to 66 mol% This indicates that the parental magma for the intrusion is highly fractionated. Extensive fractional crystallization and density-driving crystal sorting appear to have played a critical role in the formation of important Fe-Ti oxide layers in the upper parts of Units I and II. Clinopyroxene trace element analyses indicate that the parental magma for the Xialan intrusion is characterized by pronounced negative Nb-Ta anomalies. Some of the zircon crystals from the Xialan intrusion have epsilon(Hf)(t) &gt; 10 and delta O-18 between 5.2 and 5.8 parts per thousand. This, together with the depleted Sr-Nd isotopic compositions in whole rocks reported previously by others, indicates a dominant asthenospheric mantle source with significant contribution of the overlying SCLM. The epsilon(Hf)(t) and 6180 values of zircon from the intrusion are negatively correlated, consistent with contamination with crustal materials during magma ascent and final emplacement. Mixing calculation based on these data shows that &lt;20 wt.% crustal contamination is required. The negative Nb-Ta anomalies in the Xialan magma can be attributed to crustal contamination. The Al2O3-TiO2 compositions of clinopyroxene from the Xialan intrusion are consistent with those of clinopyroxene from mafic-ultramafic intrusions in continental rift zones. Based on the results from this study and previous studies by others, we propose that the basaltic magmatism in the early Jurassic in the Nanling region was related to continental rifting and asthenosphere upwelling. We interpret that the Paleo-Pacific plate flat subducted during Triassic and then the subducted Paleo-Pacific plate became delaminated and foundered at ca. 195 Ma. The early Jurassic mafic-ultramafic intrusions, syenites and bimodal volcanic rocks represent a rift-related magmatism in response to the upwelling of asthenospheric mantle, originating from different degrees of mixing of magma from partial melting of the asthenospheric mantle and overlying SCLM due to the break-up of subducted flat-slab beneath SE China continent (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Extending approximately 1300 km and located in the Western Kunlun Mountains, the Hetian nephrite belt is the largest nephrite belt in the world and contains approximately 11 major deposits and more than 20 orebodies including the Alamas deposit. Hetian nephrite deposits can be classified as Mg-skarn deposits with Precambrian dolomitic marble host rock and green, green-white and white nephrite zones are distributed gradually in the zone of a granodiorite pluton. The green nephrite is mainly predominately composed of tremolite with generally minor to trace constituents of diopside, grossularitic garnet, actinolite and other minerals. Also green nephrite has higher content of TFe2O3, than green-white and white nephrites have. We subdivided the zircons from the green nephrites into four types, depending on their internal textures, mineral inclusions, and SHRIMP U-Pb ages. Type I zircons are round instead of idiomorphic in shape and lack obvious zoning. Type II and IV zircons have broad, clear oscillatory zoning and are hypidiomorphic or idiomorphic in shape; they contain inclusions of diopside, tremolite, chlorite and calcite. Most Type III zircons are narrow rims (&lt;10 pm) surrounding Type II and Type I zircons with highly luminous brightness and no zoning. Both Type land Type II zircons have individual ages of 411 to 445 Ma and Type IV zircons have younger ages (388 to 406 Ma). Among the concordant ages, 425.7 +/- 5.8 Ma and 420.0 +/- 9.9 Ma for the QYZr1 and QYZr2 are consistent within error, with the 418.5 +/- 2.8 Ma of the Alamas granodiorite formation age and the maximum age of the Alamas nephrite deposit. The partially recrystallization of zircons during skarn formation possibly lead to some younger individual ages (406.5 to 308 Ma). In the Western Kunlun Mountain, both Buya granite and Alamas grandiorite are high Ba-Sr granites and crystallized in Western Kunlun Orogen. The Buya granite formed at about 430 Ma in a post-orogenic tectonic environment. Considering Alamas granodiorite formed at about 12 Ma younger than that of Buya granite and it is convincible that Alamas granodiorite also formed at a post-orogenic tectonic environment. Together with the evolution of Western Kunlun Mountain, it is also possible that high Ba-Sr Alamas granodiorite and the nephrite deposit formed in the post-orogenic stage. Most zircons in the Alamas granodiorite and green nephrite have high Th/U ratios (&gt;0.1), similar REE and trace element patterns, a Ce anomaly (Ce/Ce* &gt; 5), and Sigma REE contents of 454 to 922 ppm and 102 to 3182 ppm with averages of 627 ppm and 855 ppm, respectively. The similar geochemical signatures, morphologies, and ages indicate that most zircons (or fragments of zircon) in the nephrite came from the granodiorite and some experience partially recrystallized during skarnization. This is consistent with the field observation that original granodiorite-dolomitic marble boundary is now represented within a nephrite sequence, with the green nephrite close to the granodiorite and the white/white-green nephrites adjoining the dolomitic marble. Typical skarn deposits experience prograde and retrograde metasomatism stages. According to the field observations and petrographic studies, both prograde metasomatism and the early retrograde altered stages are two main stages for the formation of Alamas nephrite deposits. The replacements of coarse-grained tremolite by fine-grained tremolite (nephrite) lead to the formation of nephrite.
   <br>Based on petrographic studies, the main formation processes of the nephrite are 1) diopside &lt;- dolomite; 2) tremolite (nephrite) diopside; and 3) chlorite &lt;- tremolite (nephrite). Thus, the timing of the formation of nephrite is later than that of Mg-skarn. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The origin of intraplate volcanism not directly part of a hotspot track, such as diffuse seamount provinces, and the extent of mantle plume influence on the upper mantle remain enigmatic. Here we present new Ar-40/Ar-39 age data and geochemical (major and trace-element and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic) data from seamounts on the Cocos Plate presently located offshore of NW Costa Rica and SW Nicaragua. The seamounts (similar to 7-24 Ma) require mixing of an enriched ocean island basalt composition, similar to that of the Northern Galapagos Domain, with two depleted components. One of the depleted components is similar to East Pacific Rise normal mid-ocean ridge basalt and the other has more depleted incompatible elements, either reflecting secondary melting of MORE or a depleted Galapagos plume component Seamounts with ages significantly younger than the ocean crust formed in an intraplate setting and can be explained by northward transport of Galapagos plume material along the base of the Cocos Plate up to 900 km away from the hotspot and 250-500 km north of the Galapagos hotspot track. We propose that melting occurs due to decompression as the mantle upwells to shallower depth as it flows northwards, either due to changes in lithospheric thickness or as a result of upwelling at the edge of a viscous plug of accumulated plume material at the base of the lithosphere. The tholeiitic to alkaline basalt compositions of the Cocos Plate Seamounts compared to the more silica under-saturated compositions of Hawaiian rejuvenated and arch (alkali basalts to nephelinites) lavas are likely to reflect the significant difference in age (&lt;25 vs similar to 90 Ma) and thus thickness of the lithosphere on which the lavas were erupted.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Luliang Complex is situated in the central part of the western margin of the Trans-North China Orogen (TNCO) in the North China Craton (NCC), and consists of metamorphic volcanic and sedimentary rocks and granitoid intrusions. The Yuanjiacun Formation metasediments occupy roughly the lowest part of the Luliang Group and are mainly represented by well-bedded meta-pelites (chlorite schists and sericite-chlorite phyllites), banded iron formations (BIFs) and meta-arenites (sericite schists), which have undergone greenschist-facies metamorphism. The youngest group of detrital zircons from the meta-arenite samples constrains their maximum depositional age at similar to 2350 Ma. In combination with previous geochronological studies on meta-volcanic rocks in the overlying Jinzhouyu Formation, the depositional age of the Yuanjiacun Formation can be constrained between 2350 and 2215 Ma. The metasediments have suffered varying degrees of source weathering, measured using widely employed weathering indices (e.g., CIA, CIW, PIA and Th/U ratios). Source rocks of the low-Al meta-pelites have undergone severe chemical weathering, whereas those of the meta-arenites and high-Al meta-pelites have suffered relatively moderate chemical weathering. Significant secondary K addition is recognized in the A-CN-K diagram for most of the studied samples. Diagnostic geochemical features like the Al2O3/TiO2 values, trace element ratios (e.g., Th/Sc) and REE patterns, suggest that the meta-arenites and high-Al meta-pelites are predominantly derived from felsic igneous sources, whereas the low-Al meta-pelites are sourced mainly from mafic rocks. Coupled with Nd isotopic data, it is proposed that the meta-arenites and high-Al meta-pelites were sedimentary erosion products of the less differential felsic terrain (likely the old upper continental crust). The low-Al meta-pelites, however, have geochemical affinities with both pelite- and BIF-like components, suggesting that they were mixtures of these two sediments. Moreover, the U-Pb ages of detrital zircons from the Yuanjiacun metasediments yield three age populations of 2.8-2.65 Ga, 2.6-2.5 Ga and 2.5-2.35 Ga. The dominant Archean detrital zircons were most likely sourced from both the Archean igneous rocks in the Hengshan-Wutai-Fuping belt and old hidden Archean basement rocks in the Western Block, whereas the subordinate Paleoproterozoic detrital zircons were probably derived from the granitoid plutons within this age range in the Luliang Complex. Taking the geochemical and geochronological data together, the Yuanjiacun Formation is interpreted as having been deposited in a passive margin setting (likely the eastern margin of the Western Block), most probably on a stable continental shelf.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Carboniferous igneous rocks constitute volumetrically minor components of Iranian crust but preserve important information about the magmatic and tectonic history of SW Asia. Ghushchi granites and gabbronorites in NW Iran comprise a bimodal magmatic suite that intruded Ediacaran-Cambrian gneiss and are good representatives of carboniferous igneous activity. Precise SIMS U-Pb zircon ages indicate that the gabbronorites and granites were emplaced synchronously at similar to 320 Ma. Ghushchi granites show A-type magmatic affinities, with typical enrichments in alkalis, Ga, Zr, Nb and Y, depletion in Sr and P and fractionated REE patterns showing strong negative Eu anomalies. The gabbronorites are enriched in LREEs, Nb, Ta and other incompatible trace elements, and are similar in geochemistry to OIB-type rocks. Granites and gabbronorites have similar epsilon(Nd)(t) (+ 1.3 to +3.4 and -0.1 to + 4.4, respectively) and zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) ( + 1.7 to + 6.2 and + 0.94 to + 6.5, respectively). The similar variation in bulk rock epsilon(Nd)(t) and zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) values and radiometric ages for the granites and gabbronorites indicate a genetic relationship between mafic and felsic magmas, either a crystal fractionation or silicate liquid immiscibility process; further work is needed to resolve petrogenetic details. The compositional characteristics of the bimodal Ghushchi complex are most consistent with magmatic activity in an extensional tectonic environment. This extension may have occurred during rifting of Cadomian fragments away from northern Gondwana during early phases of Neotethys opening. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Observed geochemical and geophysical signatures in the southern Svecofennian domain (SD) and the Transscandinavian Igneous Belt (TIE) are explained through a model of tectonic cycling and episodic southwestward migration of a subduction zone system. The Vastervik area is located between these two major tectonic domains and as such has received much attention. Granitoids of the Vastervik area were recently re-grouped and classified within the context of this larger regional tectonic model, but a discrepancy between previous relative age estimations and the few available granitoid age determinations was noted. To address this issue, we have dated 13 granitoid samples using a high spatial resolution secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) U-Pb technique. Our new results constrain the intrusion of the majority of granitoids to 1819-1795 Ma, thus placing them into the TIB-1 period. This age range also encompasses our new ages from the central granodiorite belt and the Oro-Hamno pluton, demonstrating a previous overestimation of older granitoid generations in the Vastervik area. Nonetheless, it is shown that Askersund/TIB-0 magmatism, represented by an augen gneiss sample dated to 1846 Ma, is unambiguously present as far south as the Vastervik region. The anatectically generated leucogranites reveal TIB-1 ages and, as expected, older inherited zircon derived from the parental metasedimentary Vastervik formation. By simple Sr-Nd isotope modeling it is further possible to deduce that most TIB-1 granitoids follow a simple (assimilation-) fractional crystallization petrogenetic trend. The youngest granitoid generation was produced through low-pressure fluid-absent crustal melting. In conclusion, granitoids of the Vastervik area fit well into the proposed model for south-westward migration of a subduction zone system active in the Svecofennian domain and represent a new tectonic cycle. It is therefore possible to link the Svecofennian domain and the Transscandinavian Igneous Belt within a single evolutionary scenario explaining the observed granitoid petrology, geochemistry and geochronology. The study area is located at the edge of a particularly long-lived active continental margin that started to operate during the supercontinent Columbia at ca. 1.8 Ga and the presented model explains how this margin initiated at its eastern end.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>We present the results of a geochemical and geochronological study for Late Triassic (230 220 Ma) adakitic plutons within the Archean terrane of the eastern part of the North China Craton (NCC). These plutons show adakitic signatures with high Sr, Sr/Y, (La/Yb)(N), and low Cr and Ni. The enriched Nd-Hf isotopic compositions (epsilon(Nd)(t) = -13.3 to -12.9; epsilon(Hf)(t) = -17.4 to -14.6) and old Nd (T-DM2 = 2078-2037 Ma) and Hf (T-DM2 = 2366-2192 Ma) isotope model ages suggest that the adakitic pluton may be derived from the underplated mafic lower crust of Paleoproterozoic age. The relatively low Cr and Ni contents and lower epsilon(Nd)(t) and epsilon(Hf)(t) values of the Taili adaldtic plutons imply negligible input of mantle materials. Calculations of equilibrium mineral assemblages and modeling of trace element partition between melts and residual phases at different pressures confirm the interpretation that the petrogenesis of the Taili adakitic plutons is consistent with partial melting of the Paleoproterozoic mafic lower crust at 10-12 kbar (36-43 km) with a garnet granulite residue. Melting of the ancient mafic lower crust may be triggered by excess heating of the upwelling mantle in an extensional setting evoked by the contemporary subduction toward beneath the NCC from both north and south, which could serve as one possible mechanism for the destruction or lithospheric thinning of the NCC. Complex mantle-crust interaction through various mechanisms may have been responsible for the long-lived process of destruction or lithospheric thinning, which might have begun as early as in the late Triassic.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Early Permian Tarim large igneous province (Tarim LIP) consists mainly of basaltic lavas, mafic-ultramafic intrusions including dikes and, syenite bodies in the Tarim Basin, NW China. A major unit of the Tarim LIP, the Wajilitag intrusive complex, consists of olivine pyroxenite, clinopyroxenite and gabbro units (from bottom to top), diorite and syenite rocks occurred in the upper part of the complex and alkali mafic dikes intrude the dinopyroxenite phase. Here we report the zircon U-Pb age and Hf isotopes, geochemical characteristics and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic data of the alkali mafic dikes, and diorite, aegirine-nepheline syenite and syenite porphyry units in the Wajilitag intrusive complex. Zircons from the diorite and alkali mafic rocks yield concordant crystallization ages of 275.2 +/- 12 Ma and 281.4 +/- 1.7 Ma, respectively. The diorite and syenitic rocks in Wajilitag area have a narrow range of SiO2 contents (51.9-57.3 wt.%), and are enriched in total alkalis (Na2O + K2O = 8.3-143 wt.%), among which the aegirine-nepheline syenite and syenite porphyry have the geochemical affinity of A-type granites. The alkali mafic rocks and syenitic rocks have high Al2O3 (19.4-21.1 wt.%), Zr, Hf, Ba contents, total rare earth element abundances and LREE/HREE ratios and low Mg# value, K, P and Ti contents. Diorites have lower Al2O3 contents, total REE abundances and LREE/HREE ratios and higher Mg# values than the alkali mafic rocks and syenitic rocks. The diorites and syenitic rocks have low initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios (0.7034-0.7046), and high epsilon Nd(t) values (0.1-4.1) and zircon epsilon Hf(t) values (-0.9-4.4). All the diorites and syenitic rocks show the Pb-206/Pb-204 ratios ranging of 18.0-19.5, Pb-207/Pb-204 of 15.4-15.6 and Pb-208/Pb-204 of 38.0-39.9. Sr-Nd isotopic ratios indicate a FOZO-like mantle source for the diorite and syenitic rocks, similar to that of the mafic-ultramafic rocks in the Wajilitag complex. In contrast, zircon Hf isotopes of basalt and syenite elsewhere in the Tarim LIP indicate a FOZO-like component may also contribute to Tarim LIP magmatism. Geochemical and Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotopic features reflect that diorites and syenitic rocks are probably derived from a FOZO-like mantle source, consistent with a plume mantle origin and then underwent crystal fractionation process.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Central Luconia is a geological province of the Sarawak Basin, offshore NW Borneo, characterised by extensive development of Miocene to Recent carbonate build-ups. In the subsurface, many of these build-ups are reservoirs for hydrocarbons. This study focuses on shelf-wide stratigraphic architecture, from which implications are drawn for the stratigraphic-sealing potential of the deltaic clastics. A stratigraphic model is proposed whereby clastic sediments surrounding the carbonate build-ups are interpreted as stacked low-relief deltas deposited in response to high-frequency oscillation of the sea level. The deltas are shown to have frequently prograded beyond carbonate build-ups. As a result of interaction between eustacy and deposition, deltaic topsets are juxtaposed against carbonate build-ups, providing migration routes for hydrocarbons. Most of the carbonate reservoirs are consequently underfilled, with hydrocarbon columns limited to the youngest onlapping stratigraphic sequence. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Chagan sag has the greatest oil and gas exploration potential among other sags in the Yingen Ejinaqi Basin, Inner Mongolia. The average geothermal gradient in the Chagan sag is 33.6 degrees C/km, whereas the heat flow ranges from 65.9 mW/m(2) to approximately 85.5 mW/m(2), with an average value of 74.5 mW/m(2). Thermal history reveals that the Chagan sag experienced the following 4 stages of thermal evolutions: (1) a rapidly increasing geothermal gradient stage from the Early Cretaceous Bayingebi Formation depositional period to the Early Cretaceous Suhongtu Formation depositional period; (2) a geothermal gradient peak stage during the Early Cretaceous Yingen Formation depositional period; (3) a high geothermal gradient continuation stage during the Late Cretaceous Wulansuhai Formation depositional period; and (4) a thermal subsidence stage during the Cenozoic. Tectonic subsidence analysis reveals that the area experienced an initial synrift subsidence during the Early Cretaceous followed by a subsequent long-term thermal subsidence since Late Cretaceous. Thermal and tectonic subsidence histories of this area are of great significance to petroleum exploration and hydrocarbon resource assessment because they bear directly on issues of source rock maturation. The maturation histories of the 3 sets of source rocks in the sag were modeled on the basis of the present geothermal field, thermal history and tectonic subsidence history. The results reveal that the hydrocarbon generation of the Chagan sag was controlled by the Early Cretaceous geothermal fields, and the source rock maturity reached the maximum at the end of the Yingen Formation depositional period. Moreover, the maturation evolution degree shows a difference for the 3 sets of source rocks. The source rocks of the Bayingebi 1 and 2 Formations reached the middle mature and dry-gas stage. In contrast, the source rocks of the Suhongtu 1 Formation only reached the early mature and middle mature stage. This work may provide new insights for the understanding of the oil and gas exploration potential of the Chagan sag. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Despite the enormous areas deep-water basins occupy in modern oceans, our knowledge about them remains poor. At depths of greater than 2000 m, the Cenozoic Norway Basin in the northernmost part of the Atlantic Ocean, is one such basin. Interpretation of 2D multichannel seismic data suggests a three-stage evolution for the Norway Basin. (1) Eocene-Pliocene. This time period is characterised by deposition of ooze-rich sediments in a widening and deepening basin. (2) Early-Middle Pleistocene. A significant shift in sedimentary processes and depositional environments took place in the Early Pleistocene. Mass failures initiated on the Norwegian continental slope, and three Early and Middle Pleistocene slide debrites, with maximum thicknesses of 600 m and sediment volumes of up to 25x 10(3) km(3), were deposited. With ages estimated at c. 2.7-1.7 Ma, 1.7-1.1 Ma and 0.5 Ma, these slide deposits are among the largest identified worldwide, and among the oldest mapped along the entire NE Atlantic continental margin. (3) Late Pleistocene-Present. Since c. 0.5 Ma the Norway Basin has been effected by glacigenic debris flows, the Storegga Slide and hemipelagic-glacimarine sedimentation. These sedimentary processes were active during a time of repeated shelf-edge ice advances along the NE Atlantic continental margin. This study shows that deep-water basins represent dynamic depositional environments reflecting regional tectonic and climatic changes trough time. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</td>

The seismic lines cover nearly the entire Black Sea Basins, including Russia, Turkey, Ukraine, Romania and Bulgaria sectors. A new map of acoustic basement relief and a new tectonic structure scheme are constructed for the Black Sea Basins. The basement of the Black Sea includes areas with oceanic crust and areas with highly rifted continental crust. A chain of buried seamounts, which were interpreted as submarine volcanoes of Late Cretaceous (Santonian to Campanian) age, has been identified to the north of the Turkish coast. On the Shatsky Ridge, probable volcanoes of Albian age have also been recognized. Synorogenic turbidite sequences of Paleocene, Eocene and Oligocene ages have been mapped. In the Cenozoic, numerous compressional and transpressional structures were formed in different parts of the Black Sea Basin. During the Pleistocene Quaternary, turbidites, mass-transport deposits and leveed channels were formed in the distal part of the Danube Delta. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This paper is conceived as a contribution to understanding the tectonic setting in the Jabulca region in the Central Adriatic Sea, one of the seismically active regions within the Mediterranean. This seismicity is the result of the compressional tectonics within the Adria microplate, accompanied by halokinetic activity. The Jabuka Islet and the Jabuka Shoal appear to be Triassic igneous bodies extruded by diapir tectonics. Sedimentological, mineralogical and micropaleontological analyses of the surface sediments were done to provide insights into the depositional environment around these igneous outcrops.
   <br>Coarse-grained gravelly sands surrounding the Jabuka Islet and the Jabuka Shoal are composed predominantly of biogenous detritus, containing small amounts of particles derived from igneous rocks. This highly carbonate sediment cover has been formed in the low-energy environment, below wave base and without terrigenous supply from remote areas. A peculiar finding of reworked Lower Miocene foraminiferal assemblage in the recent surface sediment accompanied with re-interpreted seismic profile was used to propose a conceptual geodynamic model for the Jabuka diapir protrusion. It suggested Miocene age for the earliest protrusion of the Jabuka diapir, followed by further Plio-Quaternary growth and shaping. Together with mostly Paleogene fossil calcareous nannoplankton, fossil foraminifera were presumed to have been weathered from the pierced and extruded overburden rocks and admixed to recent, slowly forming carbonate skeletal association, typical for cool-temperate depositional environments.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Lack of a suitable gold source has long been regarded as a major argument against a palaeoplacer model for the exceptionally well-endowed Witwatersrand gold province. By comparing worldwide Witwatersrand-type deposits/occurrences, ranging in age from 3.1 to 1.8 Ga, we propose that the primary concentration of gold in the continental crust resulted from atmospheric and biological evolution in the Mesoarchaean. A high Au flux off the Archaean land surface (orders of magnitude greater than today's) was a consequence of the chemistry of the Mesoarchaean atmosphere and hydrosphere. When early life gradually changed from anaerobic anoxygenic to oxygenic photosynthesizers at around 3.0 Ga, the first 'whiffs' of free oxygen produced by photosynthesis under an overall reducing atmosphere provided the ideal trap for Au dissolved in the huge reservoir in meteoric and shallow sea water. Oxidative precipitation of gold on the surface of the O-2-producing microbes, probably cyanobacteria, could fix huge amounts of gold over large areas. Some of this microbially mediated gold is still preserved in thin kerogen layers ("carbon seams") that typically developed on erosional unconformities, scour surfaces and bedding planes in near-shore environments at around 2.9 Ga. This gold provided the principal source for the very rich placer deposits that formed by the subsequent sedimentary reworking of the delicate microbial mats on aeolian deflation surfaces, into fluvial channels and delta deposits, represented by Meso- to Neoarchaean auriferous conglomerates. Tectonic reworking of these first gold-rich sediments by orogenic processes explains the temporal peak of orogenic-type gold formation at around 2.7 to 2.4 Ga. With time, the strongly gold-enriched Archaean sediments became progressively eroded, covered or tectonically reworked, and their role as potential source of younger placer deposits diminished. This explains why Witwatersrand-type deposits younger than 2.4 Ga are rare and far less well-endowed and effectively missing in the rock record after 1.8 Ga.</td>

It is noteworthy that changes in the taxonomic composition of analogous ecobiomorph groups are connected with certain biotic or abiotic factors. The analysis of these factors allows the recognition of presumable causes of the crises in communities, which are determined to a greater or lesser extent by taxonomic changes. It is shown that the crisis in the middle of the Permian was caused primarily by abiotic (tectonic) reasons, while the crisis at the end of the Permian was complex, determined by a combination of biotic, local tectonic, and global factors.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Fulongquan Depression is a major production area for natural gas in the Songliao Basin. This study was based on geochemical analysis of source rocks. Our results indicate that the kerogen types are primarily type III. These rocks represent a source of gas in a highly mature stage. The basin was formed during two major events of tectonic subsidence and uplift between 144 and 95 Ma before present. These periods were followed by a stable sedimentary burial phase. In the Cretaceous fault period, processes of secondary hydrocarbon generation were present. Corresponding to the two major tectonic subsidence movements, there were two key hydrocarbon generation processes. Contingent on research on sedimentary facies, source rock thicknesses, and the distribution and intensity of hydrocarbon generation, the northern and southern parts of this depression represent favorable areas for the exploration and development of hydrocarbon extraction.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The architecture of coastal sequences in tectonically-active regions results mostly from a combination of sea-level and land-level changes. The objective of this study is to unravel these signals by combining sequence stratigraphy and sedimentology of near-shore sedimentary sequences in wave-built terraces. We focus on Santa Maria Island at the south-central Chile margin, which hosts excellent exposures of coastal sediments from Marine Isotope Stage 3. A novel method based on statistical analysis of grain-size distributions coupled with fades descriptions provided a detailed account of transgressive-regressive cycles. Radiocarbon ages from paleosols constrain the chronology between &gt;53 and similar to 31 cal ka BP. Because the influence of glaciations can be neglected, we calculated relative sea-level curves by tying the onset of deposition on a bedrock abrasion platform to a global sea-level curve. The observed depositional cycles match those predicted for uplift rates between 1.2 and 1.8 m/ka. The studied sedimentary units represent depositional cycles that resulted in reoccupation events of an existing marine terrace. Our study demonstrates wave-built marine terrace deposits along clastic shorelines in temperate regions can be used to distinguish between tectonic uplift and climate-induced sea-level changes.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Results of stratigraphic and morphotectonic analyses on fluvial terraces at the outlet of the Meduna valley in the eastern Southern Alps are used to investigate on the tectonics and paleoclimate. The Meduna valley, prone to destructive earthquakes, belongs to the front of the eastern Southern Alps, a south-verging fold and thrust belt in evolution from the Middle Miocene to the present, constructed by ENE-WSW striking, SSE-verging medium to low-angle thrusts, gradually propagating in the Venetian-Friulian plain. In the study area, located south of the Periadriatic thrust, the main structural element is the ENE-WSW striking Maniago-M. Jouf thrust system. Seven depositional units, ranging in age from Pliocene to Holocene, and a hierarchy of four numbered terrace complexes were identified. Stratigraphic and geometric relationships between sedimentary units, basal surfaces and terraces allow the reconstruction of the chronology of the depositional events. The study shows that the valley configuration has been shaped during the Pliocene-Quaternary with long-lasting steady intervals, interspaced with periodic tectonic pulses of the thrust front of the eastern Southern Alps. The most recent pulse related to the Maniago thrust shows an upper Pleistocene-Holocene slip rate of about 0.6 mm/yr. (C) 2014 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Case studies from worldwide exploration projects indicate that an integrated, three-dimensional seismic volume visualization and interpretation workflow contributes greatly to resolving the problems we mentioned by extracting critical geologic information from within 3D seismic datasets. Over the last decade, with the increasing employment and improvement of geophysical technology and following 3D seismic data acquisition and processing, the subsurface seismic interpretation workflow is composed geological data in the study area. Finally, we finished the fine interpretation of 3D seismic data and achieved a series of success and good application results. The evolution of tectonics resulted in sub-tectonic units containing the sequences of Ek, Es, Ed, Ng, and Nm. Interpretation reveals that tectonic transition zone which controlled the evolution of the sequences because of its strength, and also, the structural pattern resulted in types of fault (such as "Y" type). The seismic interpretations provide new information on subsurface geology, including the recognition of complex structural patterns in rift lacustrine basin and the presence of a tectonic transition zone at the structural center. The interpretation of these seismic reflection profiles provides new insights into the structure, geological evolution, and petroleum potential of the study area.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Calc-alkaline and alkaline intrusions of the late Neoproterozic form essential part of the Arabian-Nubian Shield. They were formed during the collision between East-and West-Gondwana. Sharm El-Sheikh area, Sinai, includes wide compositional array of these intrusions that can be considered as a case study. Variations in both tectonic and thermobarometric condition for granitic intrusions are studied. Four mappable granitic types are recognized namely monzogranite, syenogranite, alkali feldspar granites, and riebeckite-bearing granites. The monzogranite and the syenogranite of the study area are mostly I-type, whereas the alkali feldspar granite and the riebeckite-bearing granite belong to A-type granitoid. The calc-alkaline intrusions were formed in compressional setting due to decompressional melting of mafic lower crust. Partial melting and anatexing of crustal rocks are suggested to explain the protolith of the alkaline intrusions. The transition from the calc-alkaline magma to the alkaline one occurred as a result of the tectonic transition from compression regime to tectonic relaxation (extension setting) during the last stage of the Pan-African Orogeny. The amphiboles of the studied granites are classified as calcic-and alkali-amphiboles. The calcic-amphiboles are ferro-edenite while the alkali-amphiboles are typically riebeckite. Both amphibole types are of magmatic nature. Coexisting amphiboles and plagioclases are used to estimate the physicochemical parameters of magma crystallization. The syenogranite underwent temperature and pressure of formation range of 520-730 degrees C, &lt;3 kbar. The alkali feldspar granite records 450-830 degrees C, &lt;4 kbar, while the riebeckite-bearing granite records the lowest temperature condition among all varieties and estimate formation at 350-650 degrees C, &lt;4 kbar.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In an effort to understand the genesis of the pegmatitic rocks of El-Hudi and Um Hibal areas, detailed field, petrographic, and geochemical investigations were conducted. These investigations revealed evidence of two distinct modes of emplacement of these rocks. El-Hudi pegmatites are emplaced concordantly in a belt of folded gneisses and migmatites that mostly fit well with a metasedimentary protolith, which are later cataclased or even mylonitized. El-Hudi pegmatites can be classified into (1) plagioclase or sodic and (2) k-feldspar or potassic pegmatites. Their mineral assemblage, the variable forms of albite bodies in perthitized k-feldspars, and the myrmekite and graphic intergrowths are conclusive evidence indicating metasomatic and later stages of replacement. Geochemically, the peraluminous character of these pegmatites, compressional setting, partial melting parentage, and S-type affinity confirm their metasedimentary source and support a linkage with their host gneisses. The following stages explained the most accepted scenario for the development of these pegmatites "partial melting from metasedimentary protoliths, minimal fractionation and differentiation, injection into foliation, fractures and/or tectonic planes of the host gneisses, and invading the gneiss and migmatite hosts reflecting metasomatic exchanges, segregated earlier or contemporaneous with the genesis of garnet-bearing granites." In Um Hibal pegmatites, their vein-and miarolitic-type emplacements with the characteristic chilled margin of the later, the recorded hydrothermal nature of the well-preserved silica gels, and the well-crystallized accessory zircons revealed their magmatogenic origin. The similar behavior in depletion or enrichment of the rare earth element contents of Um Hibal pegmatites and their host granites indicate that they are genetically related. They have a mild to peralkaline affinity, emplaced in an extensional regime and shallow depth environment, of within plate and A(1)-type granite characters. However, the pegmatites seem to be fractionally crystallized from the residual melt of the host granites.</td>

The nature of Cu and Mo distributions were initially identified and the distributions were normalized through statistical treatment. Subsequently, the variograms were calculated for each exploration borehole and showed that both Cu and Mo geochemical variates have a spatial correlation, the result upon which the k-means clustering analysis for the whole Cu- and Mo-grade values in the area (see the text) became feasible. Based on the different geochemical behaviors of Mo and Cu, pervasive secondary hydrothermal activity which may exist for long periods, can remobilize Cu from deep parts of mineralization to the shallower levels while Mo is not remobilized significantly. However, in this paper, statistical analysis suggested that hydrothermal activity associated with secondary waters in Parkam was not effective enough to remobilize and enrich Cu. Yet the lower variation (variance) of Cu may indicate some sort of remobilization and enrichment of this element in the system (compared to Mo with higher variance); however, the process did not make the system evolve economically.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Geochemical data and U-Pb zircon results are presented for the intrusive meta-igneous rocks of the Ongole domain, a granulite-facies terrain of the Eastern Ghats Belt in India, with the aim of inferring the tectonic setting and the timing of their formation. Geochemical data suggest that the intrusive meta-igneous rocks (mafic granulites and charnoenderbites) possess trace and rare earth element composition that are typical of magmatic arcs. They are subalkaline, enriched in light rare earth elements and large ion lithophile elements and depleted in heavy rare earth elements and high field strength elements like Nb, Ta and Ti. These characteristics indicate that the primary magmas of these rocks were derived by partial melting of a depleted mantle wedge that had been metasomatized by a slab component. Zircon grains collected from five charnoenderbites are large and euhedral to subhedral and display fine-scale oscillatory growth zoning in CL images, implying a magmatic origin. The grains frequently show narrow-to-broad unzoned overgrowths, implying a metamorphic origin. The oscillatory-zoned cores yield Paleoproterozoic concordia ages of ca. 1,750-1,710 Ma, interpreted as the time of magma emplacement. The unzoned overgrowths yield very late Paleoproterozoic ages of ca. 1,630-1,600 Ma, interpreted as the timing of metamorphism. An enderbite showing both magmatic and metamorphic concordia ages of ca. 1,605 Ma points to the existence of syn-metamorphic intrusions. Together, the presented geochemical and geochronological evidence suggests that the Ongole domain was a magmatic arc near the Indian continent during the Paleoproterozoic. Subsequently, the rocks were metamorphosed during the late Paleoproterozoic, and the terrain was accreted to the Indian craton during the early Mesoproterozoic. The formation and growth of the Ongole domain magmatic arc through subduction-related accretion can be correlated with the growth of Columbia (1.8-1.2 Ga), but its accretion to the Indian craton is apparently unrelated to the formation of any super-ontinent on a global scale.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>We develop methods to incorporate paleogeographical constraints into numerical models of mantle convection. Through the solution of the convection equations, the models honor geophysical and geological data near the surface while predicting mantle flow and structure at depth and associated surface deformation. The methods consist of four constraints determined a priori from a plate history model: (1) plate velocities, (2) thermal structure of the lithosphere, (3) thermal structure of slabs in the upper mantle, and (4) velocity of slabs in the upper mantle. These constraints are implemented as temporally- and spatially-dependent conditions that are blended with the solution of the convection equations at each time step. We construct Earth-like regional models with oceanic and continental lithosphere, trench migration, oblique subduction, and asymmetric subduction to test the robustness of the methods by computing the temperature, velocity, and buoyancy flux of the lithosphere and slab. Full sphere convection models demonstrate how the methods can determine the flow associated with specific tectonic environments (e.g., back-arc basins, intraoceanic subduction zones) to address geological questions and compare with independent data, both at present-day and in the geological past (e.g., seismology, residual topography, stratigraphy). Using global models with paleogeographical constraints we demonstrate (1) subduction initiation at the Izu-Bonin-Mariana convergent margin and flat slab subduction beneath North America, (2) enhanced correlation of model slabs and fast anomalies in seismic tomography beneath North and South America, and (3) comparable amplitude of dynamic and residual topography in addition to improved spatial correlation of dynamic and residual topography lows.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Starkly contrasting tectonic reconstructions have been proposed for the Late Cretaceous to mid Eocene (similar to 85-45 Ma) evolution of the southwest Pacific, reflecting sparse and ambiguous data. Furthermore, uncertainty in the timing of and motion at plate boundaries in the region has led to controversy around how to implement a robust southwest Pacific plate circuit. It is agreed that the southwest Pacific comprised three spreading ridges during this time: in the Southeast Indian Ocean, Tasman Sea and Amundsen Sea. However, one and possibly two other plate boundaries also accommodated relative plate motions: in the West Antarctic Rift System (WARS) and between the Lord Howe Rise (LHR) and Pacific. Relevant geologic and kinematic data from the region are reviewed to better constrain its plate motion history during this period, and determine the time-dependent evolution of the southwest Pacific regional plate circuit. A model of (1) west-dipping subduction and basin opening to the east of the LHR from 85-55 Ma, and (2) initiation of northeast-dipping subduction and basin closure east of New Caledonia at similar to 55 Ma is supported. West-dipping subduction and basin opening were not driven by convergence, as has previously been proposed. Our plate circuit analysis suggests that between at least 74 Ma and subduction initiation at similar to 55 Ma there was little net relative motion between the Pacific plate and LHR, &lt;20 km of-convergence with a component of strike-slip motion. Subduction must therefore have been primarily driven by the negative buoyancy of the slab, or perhaps forced trench retreat due to orogenic collapse. We propose that at least two plate boundaries separated the Pacific plate from the LHR during this time, however, as there was little to no motion between these plates then a plate circuit which treats the Pacific plate and LHR as a single plate ("Australian" circuit) will produce similar kinematic results to a circuit which leaves their relative motion unconstrained and treats them as separate plates ("Antarctic" circuit). Prior to 74 Ma the reliability of magnetic anomalies from southwest Pacific spreading systems is questionable and it is difficult to properly test alternative plate circuits. After 55 Ma we advocate using an Antarctic plate circuit as the Australian plate circuit models that were tested predict significant net compression in the WARS, for which evidence is absent. Our preferred model makes testable predictions, such as burial of an arc beneath the Tonga and Vitiaz ridges, and Late Cretaceous to Eocene slabs in the mantle beneath the southwest Pacific, both of which can be investigated by future work. These predictions are particularly important for testing the earlier 85-55 Ma phase of the model, which is largely underpinned by ages and interpretations of South Loyalty Basin crust abducted onto New Caledonia, rather than an extinct arc or arc-related rocks.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Laji Shan and Daban Shan which are located along the southern and northern margins of the Xining Basin in the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, experienced important multi-stage exhumations during the Cenozoic. The apatite fission track (AFT) dating of 19 samples along four north-south sections in the Laji Shan and Daban Shan showed that the AFT ages of the Laji Shan from 88 Ma to 12 Ma and the ages of the Daban Shan are between 60 and 32 Ma. All these AFT ages are significantly younger than their host rock formation or sediment deposition ages. Thermal modeling of the AFT data indicated that the Laji Shan had undergone important exhumation events in the Late Cretaceous, ca. 50-30 Ma, and 17-8 Ma, whereas the only significant thermal event in the Daban Shan occurred at ca. 50-30 Ma. The exhumation of the Laji Shan during the Late Cretaceous may result from the Lhasa-Qiangtang collision. During 50-30 Ma, the Central Qilian Block rotated clockwise relative to the South Qilian Block, which led to the formation of the Xining Basin. The slow uplift of the Laji Shan and Daban Shan in this period was the isostatic adjustment of the footwalls of normal faults along the two margins of the Xining Basin. The exhumation of the Laji Shan during 17-8 Ma resulted from compression due to the clockwise rotation of the South Qilian Block relative to the Central Qilian Block, causing the inversion of the Xining Basin, a marked change in the sedimentary environments and a rapid increase in sedimentation rates.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The West Qinling Orogenic Belt (WQOB), an important part of the Qinling-Dabie-Sulu Orogen (Central Orogen), is essential to understand the prolonged evolution of the northeastern branch of the Paleo-Tethys in East Asia. Zircon LA-ICP-MS U-Pb age and Lu-Hf isotopes, bulk-rock major and trace element, and Sr-Nd isotope data for the granodiorite intrusion from the Tongren area, West Qinling are presented. LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating analyses from two samples constrain the time of crystallization of the granodiorite to ca. 241 Ma. Combined with newly published age data from other coeval intrusive rocks in West Qinling, it is concluded that an Early Indosinian magmatic event occurred in West Qinling. In-situ zircon Hf isotope data on the two samples dated exhibit epsilon Hf(t) values of -0.6 to -5.8 and -0.8 to -3.9, with corresponding T-DM(C) ages of 1312 to 1637 Ma and 1321 to 1516 Ma, respectively. Granodiorites are characterized by relatively high Mg# values (51.4-58.0), intermediate SiO2 (63.75-67.04 wt.%), high Al2O3 (14.24-15.58 wt.%) and total alkalies (6.60-8.00 wt.%) and relatively low A/CNK values (0.93-1.10). Granodiorites have I-type, high-K to shoshonitic, and metaluminous to weakly peraluminous character, showing bulk-rock geochemical features of arc-related granitoids. They are enriched in large-ion lithophile and light rare-earth elements, and depleted in some high-field-strength elements. The rocks show uniformly high (Sr-87/Sr-86)(t) (0.707616-0.708237) and low epsilon Nd(t) values (-7.9 to -7.5). Estimated crystallization temperatures for the rocks range from 720 +/- 48 degrees C (Ti-in-zircon thermometer) to 759 +/- 25 degrees C (zircon saturation thermometer). The data suggest that magmas were generated by dehydration melting of a mafic lower crustal component with additional input of a mafic component derived from the subcontinental lithospheric mantle. We conclude that the Tongren granodiorite formed in a subduction-related regime in response to slab roll-back of the northward-subducting A'nyemagen-Mianlue oceanic lithosphere.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The late Mesozoic geodynamic evolution of the Lhasa terrane (Tibet) remains controversial due to a lack of systematic geochemical and chronological data. Here we present the results of geochemical and zircon U-Pb geochronological studies of two granodiorite plutons in the Dachagou area of the northern Lhasa terrane. The zircon U-Pb dating yielded magmatic crystallization ages of 104 and 117 Ma, indicating pluton emplacement in the Early Cretaceous. On the basis of their K2O contents, the granodiorites can be divided into low-K calc-alkaline granodiorites (LKG, 104 Ma) and high-K calc-alkaline granodiorites (HKG, 117 Ma), and both types are characterized by the adakitic signatures of high Na2O and Sr contents, low Yb and Y abundances, and high Sr/Y ratios. The fact that the LKG and HKG formed at different times and have different geochemical characteristics suggests different petrogenetic mechanisms. Specifically, the LKG were generated by the interaction of an oceanic-slab-derived melt with enriched mantle, while the HKG were derived via the partial melting of the lower crust followed by hybridization with a significant amount of sediment and a minor amount of mantle. Based on these data and the regional tectonic setting, we propose that the LKG and HKG resulted from different geodynamic mechanisms: the HKG were the product of slab roll-back, while the LKG resulted from the subsequent slab break-off during the southwards subduction of the Bangong-Nujiang Ocean seafloor.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Kurosegawa belt in SW Japan preserves fragments of Early-Middle Paleozoic granitoids traditionally called the Mitaki igneous rocks and previously dated ca. 470-435 Ma by several isotope analyses such as Rb-Sr, K-Ar and U-Pb, together with high-grade metamorphic rocks and Silurian strata, in a narrow belt. However, the timing of the oldest arc-related plutonism in Japan is constrained by laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) U-Pb ages of zircon from Mitaki granitoids in 3 areas in SW Japan; i.e. Kyushu, Shikoku, and Kii Peninsula. Weighted mean U-Pb ages of these zircons are 431.8 +/- 3.9 for a granodiorite from the Mt. Mitaki area in Shikoku, 444.1 +/- 5.8 Ma for a granodiorite from Kuraoka area in central Kyushu, and 444.5 +/- 7.6 Ma for a quartzdiorite from the Nabaenohana area in western Kii peninsula, respectively. These ages confirm that the Mitaki igneous rocks have ca. 445-435 Ma (late Ordovician to mid-Silurian) ages. They are some of the oldest subduction-related plutonic rocks in SW japan. Particularly noteworthy is a "tonalite" from the Nabaenohana area, which has a unique spectrum of zircon U-Pb ages with distinct 3 clusters; ca. 700-500 Ma (Neoproterozoic-Cambrian), ca. 1350-830 Ma (Meo-Neoproterozoic), and ca. 3230-1560 Ma (Paleoarchean-Mesoproterozoic). Of the 44 dated zircon grains, the youngest (possibly xenocrystic) grains are ca. 500 Ma. Older zircon grains with ages &gt;500 Ma range up to 3230 Ma and are interpreted as inherited xenocrysts in the "tonalite". The Mitaki igneous rocks are interpreted to have been derived by melting of post-500 Ma terrigenous sedimentary rocks that yielded a unique tonalitic S-type granitoid magma. From the presence of abundant 1350-700 Ma (Meso- to Neoproterozoic) zircon grains in the "tonalite" we conclude that during the Early Paleozoic, proto-japan was located close to the Cathaysian margin of South China.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The ancient basement of the Yangtze craton in South China is poorly exposed and its early evolution is loosely constrained yet. The Dongling Complex is usually advocated as the ancient basement of the Yangtze craton without an intensive study yet. Schist and gneiss from the Dongling Complex have high SiO2 and Al2O3 contents, low CIA values. Their REE and trace element distribution patterns are similar to PAAS and average upper crust. Their delta O-18 values are generally higher than 10 parts per thousand. for quartz, demonstrating a sedimentary origin for their protolith. Detrital zircon U-Pb dating yields three distinct age populations for the Dongling metasediments: (1) &gt;2.4 Ga with negative epsilon(Hf)(t) values, mostly on cores and unzoned grains; (2) similar to 2.0 Ga with negative epsilon(Hf)(t) values on weak luminance and unzoned domains; (3) 730-830 Ma with epsilon(Hf)(t) values ranging from -24.8 to 4.9 on oscillatory zonings and fragmented euhedral grains. The zircons of different U-Pb ages exhibit similar REE patterns but different Ti-in-zircon temperatures. The zircon age populations are consistent with provenances from both the Yangtze craton and the Jiangnan orogen for the Dongling sediments. The youngest detrital zircon age of 731 +/- 13 Ma provides an upper limit for the deposition age; the geological occurrence of overlying strata provides a lower limit of 635 Ma for the deposition age. In view of the extensional setting in South China during the middle Neoproterozoic, the most plausible tectonic environment for deposition of the Dongling sediments is a failed continental rift basin between the Yangtze craton and the Jiangnan orogen. Therefore, the Dongling Complex is not the ancient basement of the Yangtze craton despite the involvement of some basement materials in its protolith. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>We present a geological evolution model for the Paleoproterozoic Ubendian Belt. This model is deduced from the metamorphic histories of metasediments and metamafites combined with previously obtained crust formation and metamorphic ages obtained from different rock types of the Katuma Block in the NW Ubendian Belt.
   <br>Geothermobarometry and pseudosection modelling of metabasites indicate that the granulitefades coronas containing garnet-clinopyroxene-quartz-hornblende formed at about 8.9-6.6 kbar and 790-700 degrees C. The formation of the corona textures is attributed to the post magmatic cooling history in the deep crust following their intrusion at about 2.65 Ga. This period correlates with the age of deposition of sediments in the Katuma Block, as deduced from the age of detrital zircon grains. The metamorphic P-T path of these sediments contrasts with that of the Archean mafic rocks. The common occurrence of sillimanite pseudomorphs after cm-sized kyanite crystals in migmatitic metapelites provides evidence that an early stage of metamorphism took place in the kyanite stability field whereas the subsequent peak metamorphism was characterised by the stability of the mineral assemblage sillimanitegarnet/cordierite-K-feldspar. Modelling of the X-mg ratios of compositionally homogenous cores of garnet porphyroblasts together with GASP barometry suggest peak P-T conditions of about 7 kbar and 770 degrees C. The formation of plagioclase coronas around garnet in metapelites, the decrease in X-mg and an increase of the spessartine fraction in rims of garnet porphyroblasts point to a near isothermal uplift after peak metamorphism.
   <br>Texturally controlled in situ U-Th-total Pb microprobe dating of monazite in metapelites resulted in two ages for metamorphic events. The monazite of the two dated samples is mostly complex and patchy zoned. The cores record ages of 1957 +/- 10 Ma and 1967 +/- 16 Ma, whereas the rims give ages of 1837 +/- 6 Ma and 1848 +/- 16 Ma. As the two ages of monazite growth zones (core and rims) are found in monazite of the rock matrix and in monazite inclusions of garnet porphyroblasts, we conclude that garnet growth occurred during or after the second metamorphic event at 1840 Ma. This interpretation is in agreement with the depletion of HREE and Y in the monazite rims. We correlate the second, highgrade event with the collisional stage between the Tanzania Craton and the Bangweulu Block. The first event that preceded the collision for about 120 Ma is attributed to the lcyanite grade metamorphism during accretionary processes and associated calc-alkaline magmatism along the continental margin of the Tanzania Craton.
   <br>Combining our new data with those of previous studies on the geochemistry and zircon geochronology we develop a new evolutionary model for the Paleoproterozoic orogenic cycle. The geologic history in the Ubendian Belt began in the Neoarchean (2.7-2.6 Ga) with a magmatic crust formation phase in an active continental margin setting. In the following Neoarchean-Paleoproterozoic (2.65-2.05 Ga) stage of a tectonically inactive, passive continental margin the protoliths of metabasites cooled under near-isobaric conditions and sediments were deposited on the Neoarchean crust. Subsequently, there was a protracted period of subduction (2.05-1.84 Ga) at an active continental margin, which was associated with magmatic additions and metamorphic events during tectonic accretions, that led to kyanite-grade metamorphism in wedge sediments. The final collision at 1.84 Ga leading to garnet-sillimanite-cordierite grade metamorphism in metapelites most likely was responsible for the exhumation of the 1880-1860 Ma MORB-type eclogites in the Ubendian Belt.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In significant contrast to other cratonic blocks of India, the Singhbhum cratonic successions record continuous depositional record from the Palaeoarchaean to Mesoproterozoic. Although the sedimentary facies characteristics and mode of stratigraphic sequence building of the Dhanjori and Chaibasa Formations are well known, sedimentary geochemistry, provenance and tectonic milieu of deposition of these two formations are hitherto unknown. The current manuscript presents geochemical and Sm-Nd isotopic data from the Dhanjori and Chaibasa Formations for the first time and combine previous sedimentological data with the goal to expand the framework for understanding the depositional and tectonic setting of these two formations. The Sm-Nd isotopic data for the Chaibasa clastics is unambiguous with respect to provenance. Average epsilon(Nd) (t = 2.2 Ga) = -0.8 +/- 1.0 and average Nd model age (TDM) = 2.51 +/- 0.08 Ga with average Sm-147/Nd-144 ratios = 0.1114 +/- 0.0041 for phyllites and quartzites indicate an extremely homogeneous source signature consistent with a late Archaean "juvenile" crustal provenance, possibly a dominantly upper crustal provenance. The Sm-Nd isotopic data from the older Dhanjori Formation also indicate broadly similar provenance as comparable lithologies in the younger Chaibasa Formation. Our Sm-Nd isotopic data is entirely consistent with the previous sedimentological data and confirms a terrestrial, riftdominated tectonic setting for the Dhanjori Formation (proximal sources, poorly mixed provenance) and a marginal marine to offshore setting for the more homogeneous Nd isotopic signature of the Chaibasa Formation (distal sources, well mixed provenance).

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Damiao igneous complex is a composite gabbro-anorthosite suite that was emplaced during the post-collisional extensional stage following the amalgamation of the Eastern and Western Blocks within the North China Craton (NCC). This magmatic suite is composed of anorthosite, leuconorite, gabbroic anorthosite, norite, gabbronorite, noritic gabbro, ferrodiorite, Fe-Ti-(P) rich gabbro and Fe-Ti ore. We present zircon LA-ICP-MS U-Pb age data on noritic gabbro, norite, leuconorite, gabbronorite, and gabbroic anorthosite from the Damiao suite. The data yield weighted mean Pb-207/Pb-206 ages of 1725 +/- 13 Ma, 1687 +/- 18 Ma, 1751 +/- 15 Ma and 1693 +/- 24 Ma, 1721 +/- 17 Ma, and 1729 +/- 14 Ma respectively suggesting a relatively long-lived crystallization process within the magma chamber during late Paleoproterozoic. The different lithologies show similar rare earth element patterns indicating a co-magmatic nature and derivation from the same magma chamber through polybaric crystallization and differentiation. The high alumina dykes of gabbronorite and noritic gabbro which are chemically identical to the parental magmas of high alumina gabbros from elsewhere and exhibit an upper mantle origin with high degree melting of spinel-bearing mantle facies. Their zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) compositions plot along the evolution line of the 2.5-3.0 Ga Neo- to Mesoarchean basement rocks in the NCC (-9.2 to -3.3) and the relatively low Cr, Ni contents (Cr: 9.33-338 ppm; Ni: 8.62-182 ppm), high Th/Ta (&gt;2.90), Ba/Zr (&gt;20.18), and low Nb anomaly (Nb/Nb* = Nb-PM/root(Th-PM x La-PM) &lt; 0.50) for chemically equivalent parental rocks deviate from typical mantle-derived melts, suggesting the input of Archean crustal components. We propose that the magma was sourced from spinel-bearing sub-continental lithospheric mantle at depths of up to 60 km, within a post-collisional extensional setting, and assimilated Archean crustal components before ascent. The heat input for the extensive melting might have come from upwelling asthenosphere triggered by the break-off of the subducted oceanic slab following the collision between the Eastern and Western Blocks of the NCC. The deep seated magma was channeled to mid-crust depth along rift zone and underwent low pressure crystallization and differentiation to form the Damiao suite. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Altogether 1130 U-Pb analyses on zircons from 25 samples across the Pajala shear zone in northern Fennoscandia were performed by LA-ICPMS methodology to study the origin of the zone. The samples were also analyzed for their Sm-Nd isotope systematics and geochemically. The new data is tested with existing geological information to elaborate the provenance and maximum depositional ages, the stratigraphic position of studied samples, and finally to assess the tectonic evolution in the Pajala shear zone area.
   <br>Chromium-enriched metasedimentary rocks are found within and to the east and west of the N-S trending Pajala shear zone. No material originating from Proterozoic felsic igneous (zircons) or mafic (Sm-Nd) rocks was found in these rocks and thus, only Neoarchean or very early Paleoproterozoic ages of deposition are possible. Our new results indicate that the bimodal 1.99-1.97 Ga supracrustal rocks of the Rovaniemi Supersuite cover a large area east of the Pajala shear zone. Based on the absence of Archean zircons typical of the metasedimentary rocks covering the Archean basement, it seems that the basement and its sedimentary cover were not exposed at the time of deposition of the Rovaniemi Supersuite. The metasedimentary rocks of the Uusivirka Supersuite, located within the Pajala shear zone, vary from hornblende-bearing metasedimentary rocks, metapelite, and meta-arkose to orthoquartzite. Their characteristic features include a dominant Proterozoic zircon population (65-87%), with a high proportion of analyzed grains yielding ages between 1.96 Ga and 1.91 Ga, and maximum depositional ages of 1.92-1.91 Ga. We record at least three metamorphic events; at ca. 1.92-1.90 Ga, ca. 1.85 Ga and at 1.82-1.78 Ga, of which the youngest can possibly be separated into two events at 1.83-1.82 Ga and 1.79-1.77 Ga, respectively. We propose a tectonic model in which continental breakup occurred at 2.1-2.05 Ga, followed by the development of a magmatic arc (Kittila arc) at ca. 2.0 Ga above a subduction zone. Two Archean continental units (Norrbotten and Karelia) collided at ca. 1.92-1.91 Ga, the Kittila arc was obducted upon the Karelia continent as a foreland fold and thrust belt, and the metasedimentary rocks of the Uusivirka Supersuite were emplaced as foreland deposits. The proposed tectonic model is based on the absence of 2.44 Ga layered intrusions, and especially 2.06 Ga rocks and 1.99-1.97 Ga rocks of the Rovaniemi Supersuite that are found only east of the Pajala shear zone. In our model the Pajala shear zone originated as a divergent plate boundary, and was multiply reactivated after continental collision with both lateral and vertical movements. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Zircon U-Pb-Hf and geochemical data provide new clues for a juvenile ITG segment in the Mineiro belt, outlined by published information about the nearby 2.35 Ga Lagoa Dourada suite. The Resende Costa Orthogneiss and coeval rocks yield U-Pb crystallization ages from 2351 +/- 48 to 2317 +/- 16 Ma and coherent Sm-Nd T-DM ages between 2.3 and 2.5 Ga. These rocks show epsilon(Nd(2.35Ga)) and epsilon(Sr(2.35Ga)) values that suggest derivation from a short-lived, slightly depleted source akin to products of island arcs, whereas the geochemistry is consistent with a tholeiitic source with minor crustal assimilation. The positive to negative zircon epsilon(Hf(2.35Ga)) suggests the subordinate involvement of crustal components during the hypothesized c. 2.35 Ga slab subduction event. In a similar manner, metabasalts (lower unit) of the adjoining Congonhas-Itaverava belt show Nd-Sr isotopic and chemical constraints indicating derivation from an early Paleoproterozoic tholeiitic source subjected to crustal assimilation. A coeval metagraywacke from the upper unit yields U-Pb zircon detrital ages as young as 2349 + 14 Ma suggesting the maximum depositional age for the precursor basin (foreland setting?) whilst most of the grains indicate contribution from nearby Archean sources. The Resende Costa-Lagoa Dourada rocks characterize the precocious arc magmatism of the Minas accretionary orogeny. This composite orogeny created the Mineiro belt and the adjoining Mantiqueira and Juiz de Fora belts in the 2.35-2.00 Ga interval. Due to such a polycyclic framework the Resende Costa Orthogneiss and coeval rocks show multiple metamorphic overprints dated at 2140 and 2050 Ma. The new and compiled data and regional geologic correlations provide evidence for a growing Paleoproterozoic landmass in the South America continent. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Garnet-orthoamphibole rock (GOR) from southern Hengshan of the North China Craton (NCC) shows a prominent porphyroblastic texture involving garnet, orthoamphibole, kyanite, sillimanite, chlorite, rutile and quartz, with or without talc, hornblende and staurolite. Garnet develops coronae or symplectite assemblages of cordierite, anthophyllite, ilmenite and quartz. The P-T and P-H2O evolution for three representative samples were determined by using pseudosections calculated with THERMOCALC. Generalized prograde paths are inferred from subtle garnet growth zoning, chlorite compositions and inclusion assemblages in garnet. The peak mineral assemblages are predicted to be characteristic of presence of garnet, gedrite, chlorite, kyanite and rutile under P-T conditions estimated to be 9-12 kbar and 650-670 degrees C. The post-peak history is characterized by isothermal decompression, developing coronae and symplectite assemblages under a mix of fluid-present and fluid-absent conditions. An idealized P-X-Mg [=Mg/(Mg + Fe) in mole] pseudosection drawn at T=655 degrees C and a P-M(H2O) pseudosection at T=630 degrees C suggest that the garnet-free cordierite-orthoamphibole rock (COR) can form from decompression of GOR assemblages when the rock is high-in X-Mg value or the decompression temperature is low. Zircon U-Pb dating yields a metamorphic age of 1964 +/- 25 Ma (similar to 1.95 Ga) and a protolith age of 2533 +/- 14 Ma, where the former was interpreted to represent the prograde- or peak stages of metamorphism. This paper validates an argument that the amalgamation of the NCC via a crust thickening event occurred at similar to 1.95 Ga, followed by an isothermal decompression and a prolonged nearly isobaric cooling process from 1.90 to 1.78 Ga.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Detrital zircons from quartzites of the Sao Roque Domain were subject of studies of crystal growth and stratigraphy, using in situ LA-ICPMS trace element geochemistry and U-Pb dating to deduce their provenance and contribute to understand the tectonic evolution of the Proterozoic metasedimentary successions of southeast Brazil. Trace element chemistry of most detrital cores indicates derivation from plagioclase-rich felsic rocks (e.g., tonalites to granodiorites); however, a small proportion may derive from gabbroic sources, as indicated by a combination of features (strong positive Ce anomaly, high Lu-N/Sm-N, low U/Yb; concave-down shape of the intermediate REE patterns). Thin metamorphic overgrowths are chemically distinct (e.g., enriched in several trace elements, especially the LREE), and were dated at 584 +/- 47 Ma, reflecting the Ediacaran metamorphism and granite magmatism that affected the Sao Roque Domain. The detrital zircon U-Pb ages for five quartzite samples from different stratigraphic positions within the Sao Roque Domain are restricted to the Paleoproterozoic and Archean (similar to 1730-3440 Ma). A striking feature of the dataset is a main peak at similar to 2.2 Ga which is characteristic of all samples; the age and abundance of Archean peaks allow distinguish two groups of samples: Jaragua and Japi, with 41-43% Archean zircons and a peak at 2.6-2.7 Ga; and Voturuna, Pirucaia and Serra da Viuva, with 16-21% Archean zircons and a peak close to the Archean-Paleoproterozoic boundary (2.4-2.5 Ga). A limited contribution of late Paleoproterozoic (Statherian) sources places an upper limit for the deposition of the sedimentary successions that is consistent with the estimated age of the metaconglomerate-metarkose rift sequence of the Sao Roque Group (Boturuna Formation), based on U-Pb dating of interlayered meta-trachydacites (1.75 Ga). Our data demonstrate that the different sedimentary successions of the Sao Roque Domain have an essentially continental (cratonic) provenance which is very similar to those of other sequences in the Ribeira Belt (Acungui and possibly also Embu Domain). The similar to 2.2 Ga age of the volumetrically most important sources, also indicated by the age of granite pebbles in metaconglomerates, is a diagnostic signature, consistent with the age of regional basement (e.g., orthogneisses from few basement nuclei in the Acungui Domain). Similarities in provenance and tectonic evolution of the metasedimentary sequences are consistent with the interpretation that the Ribeira Belt is part of the reworked border of the sao Francisco Paleoplate, displaced southwestward as a result of significant dextral orogen-parallel tectonics during the Neoproterozoic collision, and may imply that a suture zone between this paleoplate and another stable continental area to the SW lies below the Phanerozoic sediments of the Parana Basin.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Syncollisional sedimentary rocks in the Himalayan orogen record important information about the early history of the India-Asia collision. This article presents a combined stratigraphic, sedimentologic, micropaleontologic, and provenance data for the Early Eocene clastic strata (Dajin Formation) in the Kailas area, southwestern Tibet. The Dajin Formation comprises ungraded and normally graded, matrix- and clast-supported conglomerates, ungraded and cross-stratified sandstones, and massive to poorly laminated mudstones. Deposition of the rocks is characterized by subaerial and subaqueous debris flows, waning gravity flows and suspension fallout. The larger benthic foraminifera and the youngest ages of the detrital zircons constrain the depositional age to the earliest Eocene (56-54 Ma). The Dajin Formation contains abundant sandstone and mudstone clasts, indicating significant sedimentary recycling in the source area. U-Pb ages of detrital zircons are mostly clustered at similar to 120-54 Ma and have positive epsilon(Hf)(t) values, suggesting a Gangdese affinity. Clasts of the Dajin Formation are interpreted as having recycled from the forearc strata that were originally derived from the Gangdese magmatic arc. Highly immature texture and recycled provenance lead us to propose that deposition of the Dajin Formation was a result of the development of fold-thrusts in the Gangdese forearc. Our new results and published data from the coeval strata in the Himalayan orogen indicate that an underfilled foreland basin was initiated soon after the initial India-Asia collision, and the Dajin Formation records the wedge-top depozone of the basin system.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Detailed sedimentological, sequence stratigraphical and cyclostratigraphical analyses have been made from four lower Tithonian-lower Valanginian sections of the Vaca Muerta Formation, exposed in the southern Mendoza area of the Neuquen Basin, Argentina. The Vaca Muerta Formation is characterized by decimetre-scale rhythmic alternations of marls, shales and limestones, and consists of five facies associations, which reflect different paleoenvironmental conditions: basin to restricted outer ramp, outer ramp, and middle ramp. Vertical organization within the Vaca Muerta Formation shows a well-ordered hierarchy of cycles, where elementary cycles, bundles and superbundles with frequencies within the Milankovitch band have been recognized. According to biostratigraphic data, elementary cycles have a periodicity of similar to 20 ky, which correlates with the precession cycle of Earth's axis. Spectral analysis based on series of cycle thickness allows us to identify frequencies of about 400 ky and 90-120 Icy, which we interpret as the modulation of the precessional cycle by the Earth's orbital eccentricity. Cycles are probably driven by variations in carbonate exportation, as fluctuations in shallow-water carbonate production involve modifications in carbonate basinward exportation. Cyclostratigraphic data allowed us to build a floating orbital scale for the Tithonian-lower Valanginian interval in the Neuquen Basin. Correlation between studied sections allowed us to recognize a discontinuity between the Substeueroceras koeneni and Argentiniceras noduhlerum ammonite zones in the Malargue Anticline area. Orbital calibration of these sections is consistent with Riccardi's biostratigraphic scheme, wich place the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary within the Substeueroceras koeneni ammonite Zone. On the other hand, the base of the Vaca Muerta Formation (Virgatosphinctes mendozanus ammonite Zone) would be probably placed in the base of the middle Tithonian rather than the lower Tithonian, which is also consistent with our preliminary palaeomagnetic data.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The goal of this paper is to study the provenance of the southern Junggar Basin during the late Triassic to early Cretaceous, based on the detrital U-Pb geochronology, petrography and depositional environments. Eight sandstone samples from the Upper Triassic to-Lower Cretaceous were collected for detrital zircon U-Pb dating. A total of 794 effective U-Pb ages was obtained and divided into four groups: 488-2537 Ma (basement zircons), 328-482 Ma (subduction-related magmatic zircons), 254-322 Ma (post-collisional magmatic zircons), and 135-250 Ma (syndepositional magmatic zircons). These ages relate to three stages of basin evolution. (1) From the early to middle Jurassic, Tian Shan experienced continued exhumation, accompanied by progressive southward expansion of the Junggar Basin, and a peneplain was formed by the time Xishanyao Formation was deposited. Organic-rich sediments formed in a delta environment were well-developed in the southern Junggar Basin, with source rocks gradually switching from post-collisional volcanic rocks (295-307 Ma with a peak age of 300 Ma) of the southern North Tian Shan to post-collisional volcanic rocks of the Central Tian Shan (280-320 Ma with a peak age of 316 Ma) and then to subduction-related island arc rocks (402-423 Ma with a peak age of 415 Ma) of the Central Tian Shan. (2) During deposition of the Toutunhe and Qigu Formations, large scale volcanic activities occurred along the North Tian Shan Fault. Source rocks at this time include syndepositional volcanic rocks (151-161 Ma), and post-collisional volcanic rocks (290-320 Ma) of the North Tian Shan. By the time of deposition of the Kalazha Formation, Tian Shan experienced rapid tectonic uplift, leading to rapid lake regression. Alluvial fans were well developed in the southern Junggar Basin with source rocks being the underlying sedimentary strata of the north margin of the North Tian Sham (3) During the early Cretaceous, exhumation of the Tian Shan and lake transgression in the Junggar Basin happened again. Shallow lake sediments were developed in the southern Junggar Basin with source rocks being subduction-related volcanic rocks (339-419 Ma with a peak age of 415 Ma) of the Central Tian Shan and post-collisional volcanic rocks (254-305 Ma with a peak age of 298 Ma) of the North Tian Shan.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The field relationships, biostratigraphic constraints and paleoenvironmental conditions of lowermost Cretaceous platform carbonates from the eastern part of the Vardar Zone and the Circum-Rhodope Belt are studied. Field data confirm the unconformable position of non-deformed and non-metamorphosed limestones over Upper Jurassic back-arc rift-spreading ridge Sithonia ophiolites of the Vardar Zone in the Chalikidiki Peninsula and deformed arc-related greenschists of the Circum-Rhodope Belt in Thrace region. The distinguished microfossil assemblages and foraminiferal morphogroups are compatible with deposition in a shallow-water environment adjacent to the continental margin of Eurasia. The morphogroup characteristics support such interpretation and newly discovered microfossils define the age of the limestones as Berriasian to early Valanginian. The microfossil data conform to available radiometric ages for the Late Jurassic ophiolite crystallization and time equivalent Circum-Rhodope Belt thrust tectonics. Hence, the obtained results provide sedimentary evidence for pre-Berriasian accretion of the eastern Vardar Zone ophiolites to the continental margin and completion of the Circum-Rhodope Belt tectono-metamorphic history. The earliest Cretaceous sedimentation extended along the whole length of the Circum-Rhodope Belt across the north Aegean region implying a region-wide development of a carbonate platform which postdated the imprint of an important tectonic event. The sedimentation seals the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous Balkan orogenic event in the internal Hellenides at the Eurasian plate margin. This conclusion has strong implications for the geodynamic evolution of the Alpine Belt of the North Aegean region. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>High temperatures and arid climates were extensive throughout the Tethyan domain during the mid-Cretaceous, and thus greatest volumes of evaporites were deposited and widely distributed. The Mengyejing Formation, which contains the only pre-Quaternary potash salt deposit in China, is thought to be genetically related to the Late Cretaceous Maha Sarakham Formation in the Khorat Basin. The age of the. Mengyejing Formation has been a subject of debate and controversy and was previously interpreted as Paleocene in age mainly based on a few palynology and ostracoda fossils. In this paper, we report U-Pb sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe (SHRIMP) ages between 100 Ma to 110 Ma for the first time from the tuff beds interbedded with gypsum units and siltstones from the upper part of the Mengyejing Formation in the Simao Basin, southwestern Yunnan. This age indicates that the age of the Mengyejing Formation is likely Albian to Cenomanian providing precise geochronological constraint for the age of the Mengyejing Formation in the Simao Basin, which is consistent with the age of the Maha Sarakham Formation. Combined with marine origin of delta S-34 values for gypsum units in the Mengyejing Formation, the ages indicate that marine incursions from the Neo-Tethyan Ocean in the mid-Cretaceous were caused by global high sea level. However, the stratigraphic succession of the Mengyejing Formation cannot be well correlated with those of the Maha Sarakham Formation caused by marine incursion and tectonic inversion in the mid-Cretaceous.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>We analyze seismic anisotropy for the Eastern Alpine region by inspecting shear-wave splitting from SKS and SKKS phases. The Eastern Alpine region is characterized by a breakdown of the clear mountain-chain-parallel fast orientation pattern that has been previously documented for the Western Alps and for the western part of the Eastern Alps. The main interest of this paper is a more detailed analysis of the anisotropic character of the Eastern Alps, and the transition to the Carpathian-Pannonian region. SK(K)S splitting measurements reveal a rather remarkable lateral change in the anisotropy pattern from the west to the east of the Eastern Alps with a transition area at about 12 degrees E. We also model the backazimuthal variation of the measurements by a vertical change of anisotropy. We find that the eastern part of the study area is characterized by the presence of two layers of anisotropy, where the deeper layer has characteristics similar to those of the Central Alps, in particular SW-NE fast orientations of anisotropic axes. We attribute the deeper layer to a detached slab from the European plate. Comparison with tomographic studies of the area indicates that the detached slab might possibly connect with the lithosphere that is still in place to the west of our study area, and may also connect with the slab graveyard to the East, at the depth of the upper mantle transition zone. On the other hand, the upper layer has NW-SE fast orientations coinciding with a low-velocity layer which is found above a more-or-less eastward dipping high-velocity body. The anisotropy of the upper layer shows large-scale NW-SE fast orientation, which is consistent with the presence of asthenospheric flow above the detached slab foundering into the deeper mantle.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Neoproterozoic volcanic-sedimentary sequences of the southern Qinling belt, central China, were intruded by voluminous mafic dikes. secondary ion mass spectrometry zircon U-Pb dating indicates that these dikes were emplaced at 650.8 +/- 5.2 Ma, coeval with mafic rocks occurring at the northern margin of the Yangtze block. The dikes are characterized by enrichment of large ion lithophile elements, high Ti contents (up to 3.73 wt%) and Nb/Ta ratios between 14.5 and 19.6, suggesting a mantle source of oceanic island basalt affinity. Initial Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios show positive correlation with SiO2 contents and negative correlation with Zr/Nb ratios, implying that these rocks were affected by crustal contamination during the magma ascend and emplacement process. The dikes have initial epsilon(Nd) values of +0.2 to +3.3, low Pb-206/Pb-204 ratios of 16.96-17.45, and moderate Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of 0.7043-0.7076, likely pointing to the involvement of an enriched mantle source. The mafic dikes and coeval mafic volcanic equivalents in the South Qinling and the northern Yangtze are hypothesized to be related with the prolonged breakup of the supercontinent Rodinia, suggesting that continental rifting lasted until ca. 650 Ma.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Carnic Alps represent the best exposed Paleozoic succession within the Alpine domain being fossiliferous, mostly non-metamorphic and largely complete. This study focuses on the area around Mt. Pizzul, because the bedrocks record well the basin dynamics and most of the units are conodont bearing. Our aims were to contribute to the procedure of formalization of the lithostratigraphic units and to understand the depositional and deformation history of the study area. The area has been mapped, tectonic overprint constrained and the successions described, measured and dated. As a second-order aim, we discuss these data to infer the relations with other parts of the Carnic basin and to recognize the global controls on sedimentation. The depositional evolution can be sketched as follows: pre-Hirnantian ramp-type margin; Hirnantian glacioeustatic-related deposits and unconformity; pelagic deposition in a ramp-type margin (Pridoli-Eifelian); slope formation and differentiation in buildup, foreslope and pelagic environments (Eifelian-Frasnian); transgression and reef drowning (Frasnian-Visean); probable subaerial exposures likely during in uppermost Famennian and Visean times; and turbidite deposition (Visean). Global controls or deposits suggesting a global control are documented, including the Boda Event, the Hirnantian glaciation, the Middle Devonian reef growth, the Kacak Event, and the high-frequency sea-level fluctuations around the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary. The drowning of the buildups here and elsewhere in the Carnic Alps started during the Frasnian, unlike observed globally. This suggests that local tectonics lead to progressive deepening up to the transition to turbidite deposition.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>A survey of groundwater from six geothermal springs in Namibia showed high concentrations of dissolved fluoride, with values up to 18.9 mg/l. All values are higher than both the WHO limit and the Namibian guideline. High concentrations of fluoride are linked to Na-HCO3 or Na-SO4-HCO3 groundwater types, with increasing sulfate and chloride concentrations towards the south of Namibia. Values of delta H-2 and delta O-18 are more negative for the north of the country, and with increasing altitude of springs and distance from precipitation sources towards the southeast from the Indian Ocean. A shift of about 1 parts per thousand. from the LMWL for Windhoek was observed for delta O-18 samples, which was probably caused by the exchange with reservoir rocks. Values of delta S-34(SO4) reflect mixing of two principal sulfate sources, i.e., dissolution of gypsum originating from playas and interaction with sun:tic mineralization in tectonic bedrock zones. Values of delta C-13(DIC) seem to be affected by a variable vegetation cover and mainly by the input of endogenous CO2. Estimated reservoir temperatures vary from 60 degrees C to 126 degrees C, with a maximum value at the Ganigobes site. The geothermal springs of Namibia in this study do not meet drinking water standards and thus their water can be used only for other purposes e.g. for thermal spas. Treatment would be necessary to decrease dissolved fluorine concentrations for drinking water purposes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Hellenides fold-and-thrust range comprises two subparallel ophiolite belts of Triassic to Jurassic age - the external ophiolite belt (e.g., Mirdita, Pindos, Argolis) in the west, and the internal ophiolite belt in the east - broadly separated by the continental crust units of the Korabi-Pelagonian Zone. It is still a matter of debate whether these ophiolites derived from a single ocean (Meliata-Maliac-Vardar) or mark the suture of two distinct oceanic seaways (Pindos and Meliata-Maliac-Vardar). We contribute to the resolution of this controversy by studying the Migdalitsa Ophiolitic Complex in Argolis (Greece), which contains Triassic oceanic basalts and pertains to the external (western) ophiolite belt. Three key areas were mapped and several sites were targeted for structural, biostratigraphic, and paleomagnetic analyses. Radiolarian cherts in primary or tectonic contact with oceanic basalts were dated to the Late Triassic (Camian-Norian) using radiolarians, and provided paleomagnetic directions of primary origin carried by magnetite and hematite. The derived mean direction was corrected for sedimentary inclination shallowing and yielded a paleolatitude of similar to 22 degrees N that was placed in a broader paleogeographic context by reconstructing Pangea at similar to 225 +/- 5 Ma using a recent apparent polar wander path corrected for sedimentary inclination shallowing. The Late Triassic paleogeography of the Tethys Ocean was constrained using additional paleolatitude estimates from the literature, which we checked and corrected (when possible) for sedimentary inclination shallowing. According to our reconstruction, the Meliata-Maliac-Vardar Ocean between Adria - the promontory of Africa - and Europe represents the locus of origin of the Late Triassic Argolis ophiolitic rocks of the external ophiolite belt, presently resting in tectonic contact on the Pindos-Subpelagonian zones, which represent a deep-water trough with no substantial evidence of in situ oceanization in the Triassic.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The northern continental margin of the South China Sea (SCS) is located within the tectonic system of Southeast Asia, an area with a great deal of tectonic migration due to the regional tectonic movements. The available geological and geophysical data of the area are comprehensively analyzed in order to demonstrate the typical migration patterns of the Cenozoic tectonics in the northern SCS caused by the episodes of the Cenozoic tectonic movement. Furthermore, the lateral variation characteristics of the strata and the different evolution patterns of the main basins' features are assessed. It primarily focus on: (1) the Cenozoic episodic rifting from north to south in the continental margin of the northern SCS; (2) the rifting and depression time of the main basins progressively become younger as one goes from north to south, signifying that the migration of both the tectonics and the sediments within the northern SCS travelled from north to south during the Cenozoic; and (3) the lateral tectonic migration on the direction of EW is not regular in total, but in some local areas the trending of the tectonic migration is from west to east. The analysis of the tectonic migration features of the northern SCS, in combination with the regional tectonic evolution background, indicates that the observed remote lagging effect, resulted from the India-Eurasia plate collision, is the main dynamic mechanism involved in the tectonic migration within the northern SCS. The tectonic migration has significant influence on both the organization of petroleum deposits and on the hydrocarbon accumulation within the basins in the northern SCS; comprehensive understanding of this dynamic system is of great reference value in predicting the hydrocarbon accumulation and has the potential to have an enormous impact in discovering new deep reservoirs for the future oil-gas exploration.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This work applies recent advances in tectonic geomorphology in order to understand the geomorphic evolution of the Jamaican restraining bend located along the Caribbean-Gonave-North American plate boundary. We propose a classification of landscapes according to their erosional stages. The approach is mainly based on the combination of two DEM-based geomorphic indices: the hypsometric integral which highlights elevated surfaces, and the surface roughness which increases when the relief is incised by the drainage network. River longitudinal profiles were also analyzed as the drainage network responds quickly to base-level change triggered by external forcing such as tectonics. Anomalies in river profiles (knickpoints and convex segments) were mapped using stream length-gradient (SL) and normalized steepness (k(sn)) indices. The results provide new insights for understanding the complex evolution of the Jamaican restraining bend. Three main morphotectonic regions were identified in Jamaica: (I) the Blue Mountain-Wagwater unit located at the eastern tip of the island, (2) the Jamaican highlands plateau which covers most of the northern and central areas and (3) the tilted block province located along the southern part of Jamaica. Each region has a specific morphological signature which marks a different stage in the Late Miocene to present evolution of the Jamaican restraining bend. The evolution of the bend is mainly associated with the western propagation of major E-trending strike-slip faults and NW-trending thrusts. In the western and central parts of Jamaica the present-day motion between the Caribbean plate and the Gonave microplate is broadly distributed along several structures, while in the easternmost part of the island this motion seems to be almost completely accommodated along the Blue Mountain range and the Plantain-Garden Fault.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>We processed the seismic lines CROP-18 and the Tuscany segment of CROP-03, acquired in Southern Tuscany. The analyzed transects were originally designed to highlight deep crustal structures between the major reflector characterizing the geothermal fields (the K-horizon) and the Moho discontinuity. Our main target was to better depict the upper crustal structures, reprocessing the first 4-6 s reflection times with the application of advanced techniques (wave equation datuming), improving signal/noise ratio and extracting information previously hidden by approximate static corrections and surface noise. We choose the wave equation datuming technique, a process of upward or downward continuation of the wave-field between two arbitrarily shaped surfaces. The wave equation datuming was applied to move shots and receivers to a given datum plane, removing time shifts related to topography and to near-surface velocity variations. The datuming procedure largely contributed to attenuate ground roll, enhance higher frequencies, increase resolution and improve the signal/noise ratio.
   <br>The time migrated output sections show new evidence of regional continuity of high amplitude horizons, a better fitting with the surface geological setting and with well data resembling the local industry investigations. The interpretation confirms the fluids role, the contribution to the crustal reflectivity mostly by thermo-metamorphic processes and defines the tectonic setting. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>A new tectonic division of the Xing'an-Mongolia orogenic belt (XMOB) in north China has been presented according to our research and a lot of new data of tectonics, geochronology and geochemistry. Four blocks and four sutures have been recognized in the XMOB, including the Erguna (EB), Xing'an-Airgin Sum (XAB), Songliao-Hunshandake (SHB), and Jiamusi (JB), and Xinlin-Xiguitu (XXS), Xilinhot-Heihe (XHS), Mudanjiang (MS) and Ondor Sum-Yongji sutures (OYS). The framework of the XMOB is characterized by a tectonic collage of the blocks and orogenic belts between them. Different Precambrian basements have been found in the blocks, including the Neoproterozoic metamorphic rocks and plutons in the EB, the Neoproterozoic metamorphic rocks in western and eastern of segments of the XAB, Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic metamorphic rocks in middle segments of the XAB, respectively, the Neoproterozoic metamorphic rocks and Mesoproterozoic volcanic rocks and plutons in the SHB, and Neoproterozoic metamorphic rocks in the JB. The XXS resulted from a northwestward subduction of the XAB beneath the EB during the Cambrian, which was followed by the forming of the XHS and OYS in the northwest and south margins of the SHB in the Silurian, respectively. The MS was caused by a westward subduction of the JB beneath the east margin of the SHB during the middle Devonian. The three Cambrian, Silurian and middle Devonian events indicate that the XMOB belongs to a pre-middle Devonian multiple orogenic belt in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). Forming of the XMOB suggests that the southeast part of the Paleo Asian Ocean closed before the middle Devonian. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Toudaoqiao Complex is a sequence of high-pressure metamorphic rocks located along the suture zone that separates the Xing'an and Erguna blocks in northeast China. The rocks were metamorphosed up to epidote-blueschist facies at P-T conditions of approximately 0.9-1.1 GPa and 320-450 degrees C. Lithological associations and major and trace element compositions indicate that the blueschists are metabasalts with ocean island basalt (OIB) and normal mid-ocean ridge basalt (N-MORB) affinities, similar to those of the Philippines intraoceanic accretionary complex formed by subduction of oceanic crust. Magmatic zircons extracted from two samples of the epidote-blueschist facies metabasalts from the North Mountain in the Toudaoqiao Complex exhibit Pb-206/U-238 ages of 511 +/- 5 and 516 +/- 17 Ma, whereas a greenschist from the South Mountain has a (206)pb/U-238 age of 511 +/- 2 Ma; These data show that the protoliths of the Toudaoqiao Complex are of early Paleozoic age. In addition, a granitic dike from the South Mountain exhibits a weighted mean Pb-206/U-238 age of 492 +/- 1 Ma. These ages constrain the timing of high-pressure metamorphism in the Toudaoqiao Complex to 490-510 Ma. The new data support the view that the suture zone between the Xing'an and Erguna blocks is the Toudaoqiao-Xinlin Fault, rather than the Derbugan Fault as previously thought. This suture, which extends from Xinlin, through Toudaoqiao, and southern Mongolia, named the 'South Mongolia-Toudaoqiao-Xinlin Suture Zone', may be an important boundary between the Central Mongolia-Erguna and Xing'an blocks.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>New U-Pb age data and Hf isotope systematics on zircons from Middle Devonian and Lower Carboniferous units from NE China provide evidence for the depositional age of these poorly constrained units as well as for the timing of the collision between the Erguna (Ergun in some references) and Xing'an blocks in the eastern end of Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). The detrital zircons from the Devonian and Carboniferous sandstones yielded similar age spectra in probability diagrams showing three distinct peaks at similar to 450 Ma, similar to 500 Ma and similar to 540 Ma, respectively, along with Proterozoic and Archean age groups, except for a relatively young age population at similar to 360 Ma detected for zircons from the Hongshuiquan Fm.
   <br>The dating results suggest that the depositional time of the Niqiuhe Fm. should be younger than Late Silurian, as indicated by the youngest 422-Ma detrital zircon from this Fm., and that of the Hongshuiguan Fm. with a youngest detrital age of ca. 338 Ma, is younger than Middle Mississippian (Visean), which is in accordance with those inferred from biostratigraphic data.
   <br>These dominant age groups are widely found in the Erguna and Xing'an blocks, it is suggested that the sediments of the studied sandstones from Niuqiuhe and Hongshuiquan Fms come mainly from the Erguna and Xing'an blocks. The epsilon(Hf) (t) value of dated zircons from our sandstones has a wide range (-21 to 16), which shows a mixed signature of that from Paleozoic granitoids in Xing'an block (6-17) and Erguna block (-2 to 6), indicating that Erguna and Xing'an blocks had connected before the Middle Devonian deposition of the Niqiuhe Fm. (422 +/- 5 Ma). Combined with the age data, we suggest that the Erguna and Xing'an blocks started to accrete at similar to 540 Ma, reached the peak of collision at similar to 500 Ma, and went into the post-collision stage from similar to 490 to similar to 450 Ma. The study provides more evidences and constraints for the early Paleozoic evolutions of the inter-continental block amalgamations and accretions in CAOB. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This paper presents new results on zircon U-Pb dating, Hf isotope analyses, and trace and major element analyses of Late Devonian and early Carboniferous metavolcanic rocks and early Carboniferous alkaline granites of central Jilin Province, NE China, and uses these data to constrain the late Paleozoic tectonic evolution of the southern margin of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB). Zircon U-Pb ages, determined using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry, indicate that Late Devonian Jifanggou Group metarhyolites formed at similar to 360 Ma, whereas the early Carboniferous Panling Formation metabasaltic andesites and metarhyolites and the Silengshan alkaline granite formed at similar to 340 Ma. The Late Devonian metarhyolites, which exhibit zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) values of +2.77 to +8.94 and corresponding two-stage model ages (T-DM2) ages of 969-1525 Ma, are geochemically similar to I-A-type granites, which is indicative of formation from a primary magma generated by partial melting of juvenile lower crustal material in an extensional environment. The early Carboniferous metabasaltic andesites and metarhyolites are geochemically bimodal, with SiO2 concentrations of 52.1-61.4 and 72.8-75.1 wt.%, respectively. The former are enriched in Ba, Sr, Th, and U, and are depleted in K, Rb, Nb, Ta, and Ti, whereas the latter are enriched in light rare earth elements (LREEs) and large ion lithophile elements (LILEs; e.g., Rb, K, Th and U), and are depleted in heavy REEs (HREEs), high field strength elements (HFSEs; e.g., Nb, Ta, Ti, and P), and Sr. Zircons from the metabasaltic andesite and metarhyolite units have epsilon(Hf)(t) values of +9.80 to +12.8 and +11.0 to +13.1, respectively, and corresponding single-stage model ages (T-DM1) and two-stage model ages (T-DM2) of 468-606 and 584-776 Ma, respectively. Silengshan alkaline granite samples contain minor amounts of riebeckite, are relatively LREEs and LILEs enriched and HREEs and HFSEs depleted, and have markedly negative Eu anomalies, features that are typical of A-type granites. These granite samples have zircons with epsilon(Hf)(t) values of +8.04 to +13.4 and corresponding T-DM2 ages of 549-1037 Ma. These data suggest that the primary magma that formed the early Carboniferous metabasaltic andesites was derived from partial melting of depleted lithospheric mantle material that had been modified by subduction-related fluids, whereas the primary magmas for the coeval metarhyolites and the Silengshan alkaline granite were derived from partial melting of newly accreted crust. These early Carboniferous igneous rocks formed in an extensional setting within the eastern segment of the southern CAOB. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Eastern Erenhot ophiolitic complex (EOC) is one of the numerous fragments of oceanic lithosphere in southeastern Central Asian Orogenic Belt. It is composed dominantly of serpentinized ultramafic rocks with subordinate gabbros, mafic lavas and minor plagiogranite dikes. Zircons from two gabbros and one plagiogranite yielded weighted mean Pb-206/U-238 ages of 354.2 +/- 4.5 Ma, 353.3 +/- 3.7 Ma and 344.8 +/- 5.5 Ma. These ages suggest that the oceanic crust of the EOC formed in a maximum time period of 10 Ma, and that the plagiogranite may have formed later than the gabbroic section. An undeformed and unmetamorphosed dioritic porphyry dike intruded in the Carboniferous strata near the EOC has an intrusive age of 313.6 +/- 2.9 Ma and provides a possible younger minimum time limit for the formation of the early Carboniferous ophiolitic complex. All the mafic rocks have similar chondrite normalized REE patterns characterized by moderate depletion in LREE with (La/Yb)(N) (0.20-0.75) similar to normal middle oceanic ridge basalt (N-MORB). The PM-normalized trace element patterns of the gabbros and massive basalts are also reasonably consistent, essentially similar to those of N-MORB except for some enrichment in LILE (e.g. Rb, Ba) and slightly negative Ti anomalies. The plagiogranite samples are characterized by lower K2O (0.45-0.73 wt%) comparable with oceanic plagiogranite. They have LREE-enriched, chondrite-normalized REE patterns with varying Eu anomalies and the trace elements (e.g. Rb, Y, Nb) show similarity to volcanic arc granite. These geochemical features of the EOC show a similar volcanic arc affinity, suggesting that they form in a back-arc-type environment. Their origin is attributed to asthenospheric upwelling and further lithospheric extension during early Carboniferous, formed as a consequence of slab breakoff on collision of the northern early to mid-Paleozoic orogenic terrane and the Hunshandake Block.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Baolidao and Halatu plutons are located in the Northern Orogenic Belt (NOB) in Sonidzuoqi area of Inner Mongolia, which has an important significance for the tectonic evolution of Xing-Meng Orogenic Belt (XMOB). The two plutons have been intensively studied but the conclusions are still controversial. Combined with the previous study, this paper gives new geological data about the two correlative plutons for gaining a better understanding of their petrogenesis and the geodynamic setting. The Baolidao granitoids contain two different series, calc-alkaline series mainly formed in the Ordovician and high K calc-alkaline series mainly formed in the Carboniferous. The Halatu granites are formed in the Triassic and belong to high-K calc-alkaline series. This study got the zircon U-Pb ages of 316-322 Ma for the Baolidao granitoids and 233 +/- 2 Ma for the Halatu syenogranites, respectively. In the tectonic discrimination diagrams, they mainly fall into the area of post-orogenic granites (POG). Hf isotopic analyses for the Baolidao granitoids (Sample BLD-1 and 3) shows epsilon(Hf) (t) = 3.0-14.0, with two-stage Hf model age (T-DM2) of 436-1138 Ma. The Halatu syenogranite (Sample HLT-1) also shows a depleted epsilon(Hf) (t) = 3.8-8.2, with T-DM2 of 741-1024 Ma, suggesting the major involvement of juvenile crustal components. The various epsilon(Hf) values of the Carboniferous Baolidao and Triassic Halatu granitoids indicates a hybrid magma source of juvenile material with old crustal component, and the epsilon(Hf) (t) values decrease from the Carboniferous to Triassic, suggesting the increasing proportion of old continental material during this period. Combined with the regional geology, the Carboniferous Baolidao granitoids are possibly not arc rocks, but originated from the post-collisional setting. The Triassic Halatu granites were formed in the subsequently extensional environment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB) is known to be the Earth's largest Phanerozoic accretionary orogenic belt. Its southern margin, particularly in the southern Mongolia and Inner Mongolia (SMIM), shows an extensive distribution of alkaline granites. Study of these granites could shed light on long-debated hypotheses on the late Paleozoic tectonic evolution of this region. In this work, we performed a detailed zircon age determination and whole rock geochemical analysis on alkaline granites from four granitic plutons in northern Inner Mongolia (Hongol, Saiyinwusu, Baolag, and Baiyinwula). U-Pb zircon dating yielded early Permian ages (ca. 280 Ma) for the four plutons. Whole-rock geochemical analyses show chemical characteristics typical of alkaline granites. Coeval alkaline granites from southern Mongolia to northern Inner Mongolia constitute a gigantic (similar to 900 km) Permian (292-275 Ma) alkaline granite belt in the southern CAOB. Furthermore, these alkaline granites have whole-rock epsilon(Nd)(t) varying between +3.6 and +6.4 and zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) from +4.9 to +20.3. The geochemical and Nd-Hf isotopic signatures suggest derivation by partial melting of a protolith assemblage dominated by metasomatised mantle, and followed by fractional crystallization in a post-collisional extensional environment.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Mongol-Okhotsk belt and adjacent areas are key areas to study the relationship between the Okhotsk and Paleo-Pacific tectonic regimes and their superposition on the older Paleo-Asian regimes during late Mesozoic times. This paper summarizes the spatial-temporal evolution of Late Mesozoic (Jurassic-Cretaceous) granitoids and related intrusions in these areas, and interprets the magmatic evolution in terms of a transition from contractional crustal thickening to extensional thinning. According to 407 published zircon ages, these granitoids were mainly emplaced during the intervals 200-180 Ma, 180-165 Ma, 165-145 Ma, 145-135 Ma and 135-100 Ma. Jurassic granitoids (200-145 Ma) predominately occur in the Baikal-NE Mongolia (BNEM) and Great Xing'an Range. Early Cretaceous (145-100 Ma) granitoids are mainly occur in the Great Xing'an Range, and display a southward-younging migration. Significantly, Early Cretaceous granitoids also extend into the Trans-Baikal area across the Mongol-Okhotsk suture, far away from the Paleo-Pacific plate margin (in NE China); thus they were more plausibly related to post-orogenic collapse of the Mongol-Okhotsk orogen. From the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, the granitoids evolved compositionally from calc-alkaline and high-K calc-alkaline, I-type, with some adakite-like features, to high-K calc-alkaline and shoshonitic, highly fractionated I-, transitional I-A or, A-type, characterized by a significant decrease in their Sr/Y ratios. This evolution coincided with a tectonic transition from contractional crustal thickening to extensional thinning. Combined with regional geology, we speculate that the Jurassic granitoids were likely derived from melting of the deep-seated, thickened lower continental crustal (LCC) sources, whereas the Cretaceous granitoids produced through crustal melting from an extensional thinning setting. Our results provide a case study demonstrating that the petrogenesis of granitic magmatism was closely associated with crustal tectonics. Early Jurassic granitoids along the Okhotsk belt formed in a subduction/collision setting related to closure of the Mongol-Okhotsk Ocean, whereas Late Jurassic granitoids in the Great Xing'an Range and in the northern North China Craton may have formed in a syn- or post-collisional setting superposed by far-field affects of subduction of the Paleo-Pacific plate. Early Cretaceous granitoids in these areas formed in response to post-orogenic extensional collapse of the Mongol-Okhotsk belt, coupled with back-arc extension related to Paleo-Pacific plate subduction.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Mesozoic granitic rocks are widely distributed in northeast (NE) China. However, high-Mg dioritic rocks are considerably rare. Here, we report a newly recognized high-Mg diorite (the Xintun diorite) in the Yanji area, NE China, to constrain its origin and implications for the tectonic evolution of eastern Asian continental margin. Zircon U-Pb dating yields a crystallization age of 128 +/- 1 Ma for the Xintun diorite. The diorites are characterized by high MgO (4.4-6.6 wt.%), Cr (119-239 ppm), Ba (419-514 ppm) and Sr (649-747 ppm) contents and Mg# values (59-64), but low FeOtotal/MgO ratios (1.2-1.4), with geochemical features similar to those of sanukitic high-Mg andesites (HMAs). They show moderate radiogenic Sr (I-Sr = 0.7047-0.7050) and Nd (epsilon(Nd) = 0.3-1.1), with high La/Sm ratios, which are indicative of contributions from sediment components. The mineral assemblage of euhedral hornblende, magnetite and titanite, implies a water-rich and oxidized signature for their primitive magmas. These features suggest that the Xintun high-Mg diorites were probably formed via partial melting of the subducting sediments and subsequent interaction of mantle peridotites with both melts and aqueous fluids. Geochemical modeling reveals that hornblende-dominated fractional crystallization under water-sufficient conditions enabled the evolved magmas to acquire adakitic signatures. We believe that the Paleo-Pacific subduction beneath eastern Asian continental margin caused large-scale back-arc extension of NE China in the Early Cretaceous, and, consequently, induced the asthenospheric flow toward the mantle wedge, reheating subducting sediments enough to cause melting. Therefore, the occurrence of the Xintun high-Mg diorites signifies the onset of extensive back-arc extension of eastern Asian continental margin at ca. 128 Ma. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The East Ujimqin Banner, located in the western segment of the Great Xing'an Mountains, NE China, has undergone a long and multi-stage tectonic evolution, which has resulted in significant Fe-Ag-Pb-Zn-Au-Cu-Mo deposits. There are two main types of mineralization: vein and skarn types. The Jilinbaolige and Aerhada vein deposits, and the Chagan Obo and Chaobuleng skarn-type deposits are four typical deposits in this area. The vein deposits mainly occur as veins with hydrothermal alteration in fractures within pre-mineralization clastic rocks and felsic volcanic rocks. The skarn-type deposits always show a temporal and spatial relationship with Mesozoic granite intruded into Paleozoic limestone. The sulfur isotope data from the sulfides in these four deposits have a very narrow range (+1 parts per thousand to +8 parts per thousand), suggesting that most were derived from magma. The Pb-206/Pb-204, Pb-207/Pb-204 and Pb-208/Pb-204 ratios range from 17.949 to 18.529, 15.370 to 15.691 and 37.653 to 38.460 respectively, indicating that the metals derive mainly from the mantle source. In the diagrams Pb-207/Pb-204 vs. Pb-206/Pb-204 and Pb-208/Pb-204 vs., Pb-206/Pb-204 the points of lead isotope of the sulfide ores are very near or coincide to the IC-feldspar, indicating that the ore-forming materials sources have the genetic relationship. It seems that there are four key factors controlling the mineralization styles in this district: the tectonic setting, magmatic activity, wall rocks, and structures. The superposition of multi-stage tectonism from a Mesozoic extensional setting on a Paleozoic subduction setting provided a remobilization and enrichment mechanism for the ore-forming elements. The magmatic activities were sources of metals and fluids, and drove them to the mineralization sites. The wall rocks are key factors for mineralization styles. When metal-bearing fluid flows into clastic rocks and felsic volcanic rocks, the mineralization is mainly vein type, and mineralization in limestone is mainly skarn type. NE- and NW-trending extensional faults may have provided the channels for the movement of metal-bearing fluids and depositional space for metals. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Ordovician metasedimentary rocks are the oldest and most extensive sedimentary sequence in the Chinese Altai. They experienced two major episodes of deformation (D1 and D2) resulting in the formation of juxtaposed Barrovian-type and migmatite domains. D1 is characterized by a penetrative sub-horizontal fabric (S1), and D2 is marked by upright folds (F2) with NW-SE-trending axial planes in shallow crustal levels and by sub-vertical transposition foliations (S2) in the high-grade cores of large-scale F2 antiforms. In the Barrovian-type domain, successive growth of biotite, garnet and staurolite is observed in the S1 fabric. Kyanite included in garnet and plagioclase in the migmatite domain is interpreted to have formed also in S1. In the biotite and garnet zones, the spaced S2 cleavage is marked by biotite and muscovite, and in the staurolite and kyanite zones, the penetrative S2 fabric is characterized by sillimanite, locally with late cordierite. Phase equilibria modelling indicates that the S1 fabric was associated with an increase in pressure and temperature under Barrovian-type conditions in both domains. The S2 fabric was related to decompression, in which rocks in the biotite and garnet zones well preserve the peak assemblage, and the higher grade rocks in the staurolite and kyanite zones re-equilibrated to different degrees under high-temperature/low-pressure (HT/LP) conditions. The D1 metamorphic history is attributed to the progressive burial related to Early-Middle Palaeozoic crustal thickening and the metamorphism associated with D2 is interpreted to result from exhumation by vertical extrusion. The extrusion of hot rocks was contemporaneous with the formation of gneiss domes accompanied by the intrusion of juvenile magmas at middle crustal levels during the Middle Palaeozoic. Consequently, there is a genetic link between the Barrovian-type and migmatite domains related to continuous transition of the Barrovian-type fabric into the HT/LP one during development of domal structures in the southern Altai orogenic belt. This study has a broad impact on the understanding of the thermo-mechanical behaviour of accretionary orogenic systems worldwide. The lower crustal flow and doming of hot crust, so far reported only in continental collisional settings, seems to be also an integral mechanism responsible for both horizontal and vertical redistribution of accreted material prior to continental collision.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>An integrated field, petrological and geochronological study of the Basong Tso region of south-eastern Tibet has constrained the timing and P-T conditions of north-south Lhasa terrane accretion and provides new insight into the tectonothermal evolution of the Tibetan plateau. Two distinct high-grade metamorphic belts are recognized in the region: a southern belt (the Basong Tso complex) that consists of sheared schist and orthogneiss; and a northern belt (the Zhala complex) that comprises paragneiss and granite. Combined pseudosection modelling and U-Pb geochronology of monazite and zircon indicates that the Basong Tso complex records peak metamorphic conditions of 9 +/- 0.5kbar and 690 +/- 25 degrees C at c. 204-201Ma, whereas the Zhala complex experienced peak metamorphic conditions of 5.0 +/- 1.0kbar and 740 +/- 40 degrees C at c. 198-192Ma. Microstructural analysis suggests that the two belts share a common early prograde history, after which the Basong Tso complex attained peak conditions following rapid burial, and the Zhala complex approached peak conditions along an isobaric path. Overall it is inferred that the Basong Tso and Zhala complexes represent the lower and upper structural levels of an evolving orogen that underwent Barrovian-type metamorphism following collision (M1), followed by Buchan-style overprinting at higher structural levels due to heat advection by syn-tectonic granites (M2). Mylonitization (sensu lato) of the Basong Tso complex and juxtaposition of the two units occurred after attainment of peak conditions. The dominance of Mesozoic regional metamorphism across most of the Tibetan plateau indicates that Cenozoic crustal thickening processes, where present, are only manifested at depth.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Numerical models of geological structures are generally built with a geometrical approach, which lacks an explicit representation of the deformation history and may lead to incompatible structures. We advocate that the deformation history should be investigated and represented from the very first steps of the modelling process, provided that a series of rapid, interactive or automated, deformation tools are available for local editing, forward modelling and restoration. In this paper, we define the specifications of such tools and emphasise the need for rapidity and robustness. We briefly review the different applications of deformation tools in geomodellirig and the existing deformation algorithms. We select a deformation algorithm based on rigid elements, first presented in the Computer Graphics community, which we refer to as Reed. It is able to rapidly deform any kind of geometrical object, including points, lines or volumes, with an approximated mechanical behaviour. The objects to be deformed are embedded in rigid cells whose displacement is optimised by minimising a global cost function with respect to displacement boundary conditions. This cost function measures the difference in displacement between neighbouring elements. The embedded objects are then deformed based on their original position with respect to the rigid elements. We present the basis of our implementation of this algorithm and highlight its ability to fulfil the specifications we defined. Its application to geomodelling specific problems is illustrated through the construction of a synthetic structural model of multiply deformed layers with a forward modelling approach. A special boundary condition adapted to restore large folds is also presented and applied to the large anticline of Han-sur-Lesse, Belgium, which demonstrates the ability of this method to efficiently perform a volumetric restoration without global projections.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Warburton-Cooper-Eromanga basins of central-eastern Australia contain a number of reactivated fracture-fault networks that relate to a complex and poorly understood thermal and tectonic evolution. Authigenic illite was sampled from two prominent features of the Warburton-Cooper basins: the Gidgealpa-Merrimelia-Innamincka Ridge, composed of anticlinal imbricate thrust fault blocks, and the synclinal Nappamerri Trough. These sample sets were investigated using a combination of clay mineralogical, trace element and stable isotope analyses to deduce the palaeofluid chemistry associated with past tectonothermal perturbations. The Nappamerri Trough hosts the highly radiogenic Big Lake Suite granite and part of one of Australia's larger on-shore oil and gas reserves. Calculated fluid stable isotope values from the trough, in conjunction with calculated palaeotemperatures, indicate an influx of evolved high-latitudinal meteoric waters under an extremely high geothermal gradient (similar to 100 degrees C km(-1)) and high water/rock ratios consistent with an extensional environment. Such high water/rock ratios resulted in intense alteration of the granite during which it underwent substantial enrichment in the heat-producing elements (HPE), particularly Th. This hydrothermal system is interpreted to result from continent-wide transmission of tensional stress originating from episodic rifting of the eastern Australian margin in the mid Cretaceous, as dated by Sm-Nd, Rb-Sr and Ar-Ar. The Gidgealpa-Merrimelia-Innamincka Ridge, by contrast, is marked by a lower, but still elevated, palaeogeothermal gradient (similar to 42 degrees C km(-1)) and calculated fluid isotopic values compatible with evolved basinal fluids of meteoric origin under low water/rock ratio conditions. Distinct trace element compositions of residue and leachate aliquots further indicate two periods of fluid flow with unique chemical compositions. In light of previous geochronology, these events are interpreted as westward extensions of widespread crustal tensional stress that affected much of central and eastern Queensland in the Carboniferous and Late Triassic.
   <br>Integrated analyses of authigenic illite provide evidence for three periods of fluid flow and elevated thermal regime associated with regional tectonism during the Carboniferous, Late Triassic and Cretaceous. Our data further show that due to the extremely high geothermal gradient and water/rock ratios, Cretaceous fluid flow had profound effects on the surrounding geology, which may have formed/enhanced two of Australia's most significant energy resources.

Analyses of a new database consisting of SGY 2D seismic lines and wells indicate that the sedimentary succession on the Tarfaya margin can be divided into ten seismic sequences within four major transgressive-regressive cycles separated by regional unconformities. Variations in the stratigraphic architecture of the margin suggest that regional tectonic influences have episodically overprinted global eustatic signals. A number of clastic reservoirs and source rock intervals have been identified in this margin, but only Jurassic carbonate and Cretaceous clastic plays have been tested on the shelf area. Cretaceous submarine fans and Tertiary turbidite systems in deep-water areas remain untested and may have major hydrocarbon potential.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Ocean ridges, where Earth's tectonic plates are pulled apart, range from more than 5-km depth in the Arctic to 750 m above sea level in Iceland. This huge relief is generally attributed to mantle plumes underlying mantle hotspots-areas of voluminous volcanism marked by ocean islands. The plumes are thought to feed the mantle beneath adjacent ocean ridges. This process results in thickened crust and ridge elevation to form ocean rises. The composition of mid-ocean ridge basalt, a direct function of mantle composition and temperature, varies systematically along ocean rises, but in a unique way for each different rise. Here we use thermodynamic calculations of melt-evolution pathways to show that variations in both mantle temperature and source composition are required to explain the chemical make-up of rise basalts. Thus, lateral gradients in mantle temperature cannot be uniquely determined from basalt chemistry, and ocean rises can be supported by chemically buoyant mantle or by robust mantle plumes. Our calculations also indicate that melt is conserved and focused by percolative flow towards the overlying ridge, progressively interacting with the mantle to shallow depth. We conclude that most mantle melting occurs by an overlooked mechanism, focused melting, whereas fractional melting is a secondary process that is important largely at shallow depth.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Eskisehir Fault Zone is one of the major neotectonic structures of Turkey, extending from Inegol (Bursa) to Cihanbeyli (Konya). The fault zone presents a considerable seismic risk for the city of Eskisehir but the exact locations of active segments and the source of the major seismic event, the 1956 earthquake (M = 6.5) that occurred in the instrumental period (from 1900 to 2013), have been debated in recent literature. The structural data obtained from field studies indicate an approximately N60W-trending main strand of the right lateral strike-slip Eskisehir Fault Zone. This trend corresponds to the en echelon bends on the course of the Sarisu River. Using this concurrence, the positions of Bahcehisar and the Cukurhisar-Sultandere segments are proposed and checked by seismic reflection studies. The seismic sections disclosing positive flower structures confirm the hypothesized position of the Cukurhisar-Sultandere segment. The relocation of epicenters and focal mechanism solutions of seismic events in 1956, 1990, 2010, and 2013 indicate that the Cukurhisar-Sultandere segment might be the rupture source of the 1956 event and is a possible potential seismic source for an earthquake that could seriously affect the Eskisehir settlement.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The lower Triassic Feixianguan Formation of the Sichuan Basin is an important exploration target for marine natural gas in China. It is widely believed that a certain interval from Fei 1 to Fei 4 displays conformable contacts rather than long-term wide-ranging hiatus. However, 2 denudational interfaces on the top of Member Fei 1 and Fei 2 respectively were found in the present work, which relies on the delicate core observation of 4 cored wells in Puguang Gas Field, microscopic observations of microsamples in terms of thin sections, scanning electron microscopy and cathodoluminescence, and geochemical testing. Evidence indicates that on the top of the first and second Member of Feixianguan Formation there existed karst unconformities, which is in distinguished contrast to previous interpretations of conformable contacts. According to those geological and geochemical investigations, a new classification is proposed for the interior Feixianguan Formation. The tectonic episode division of Indosinian movement consequently may be modified from the previous conception of a first-order episode to 3 sub-first-order episodes that correspond to the impact of 2 uplifting processes during the early Indosinian orogeny. These uplifting processes are the cause in interpreting the pervasive exposure and unconformable interfaces in Fei 1 and Fei 2 karstifications. Thus, we suggest another appropriate division of 3 third-order sequences that may suit the Feixianguan Formation, which correspond to Fei 1, Fei 2, and Fei 3-Fei 4. Regional reservoir formation was also largely affected by penecontemporaneous karstification. Massive dissolution pores fill with seepage sediments but generally remain effective reservoir spaces.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Successions of a controversial period of time in the Zagros and Arabian Plate stratigraphic column, including Zakeen (Devonian) and Faraghan (early Permian) formations are investigated for their provenance characteristics. Nearly similar depositional environments of the formations, regardless of 70-80 My hiatus between them, is the main motivation for this study. Evidence from various methods are put together to reconstruct a comprehensive image of their provenance. Results from petrographic and detrital mode analysis indicate a continental block provenance for of the sandstones of both formations. In addition, evidence of recycling is evident from some rock fragments in the conglomeratic fades.
   <br>Heavy mineral diversities are limited to the ultra-stable species which represent consistent morphological characteristics in both formations. However, the values of rutile: zircon index (RZi) showed intermittent changes from low RZi to high RZi intervals in both formations. Detrital zircon age data in previous studies represented the same source for these two formations, which also remained unchanged from Neo-Proterozoic to late Paleozoic successions. Zircon grains' morphology, however, showed remarkable difference between the Zakeen and Faraghan formations on the one hand and successions deposited in the basin prior to the tectonic movements of mid-Paleozoic time on the other.
   <br>Outcomes of this study show that, although each single technique may shed light on a particular aspect of the greater provenance problem, by integration of all the data, important evidence of recycled nature of these successions could be confirmed. Changes in the thickness of the Paleozoic units, the nature of their stratal surfaces, along with the information from magmatic events in the area provide a tectonostratigraphic framework for northern margin of Gondwana in which the recycled nature of these successions is justifiable. The recycled nature of the studied formations on the one hand, and their identical provenance on the other, raise a challenge for the timing proposed for two tectonic activities of middle Paleozoic and mid-Carboniferous.

Pegmatite bodies which are zoned or poorly zoned occur as dykes trending N-S, NE-SW and NW-SE consisting dominantly of feldspar-quartz, feldspar-quartz-mica, and feldspar-mica-quartz, respectively. Trace elements concentration in the Na-rich and K-rich feldspars is such that Rb &gt; Ba &gt; Sr &gt; Pb &gt; Ga and the pegmatites contain rare metals with moderately high contents of Nb, Sn, Rb, Li and Cs. The muscovite samples have enrichment pattern of Rb &gt; Nb &gt; Sn &gt; Gn &gt; Ta &gt; Cs: each of the elements has concentration values that are higher than those in either the K-rich or Na-rich feldspars suggesting that muscovite and to a lesser extent feldspars, are the possible carriers of Ta, Sn and REE that are associated with the pegmatite bodies in the Lokoja area. The mineralogy and composition of the pegmatite bodies are indicative of post tectonic anorogenic acidic igneous protolith which underwent alkali metasomatism involving selective enrichment of trace elements and REE, fractionation and rock-fluid interactions.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The purpose of the study was to examine the extent to which drainage morphology has been influenced by faulting, folding and bedrock lithology in the Cape Fold Belt (CFB) of South Africa. This region was formed during Paleozoic-Mesozoic convergence along the south-western margin of Gondwana. An extensive structural geology database, terrain characteristics and stream network data were analysed using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to examine the possible linkages between structure and fluvial drainage. Results indicated that the contemporary geomorphology of the area reflects the influence of folding and faulting as well as differential erosion. The following drainage anomalies suggestive of strong structural control were identified: orientation of flow direction of major streams corresponding to structural lineaments, abrupt changes in stream direction influenced by anticline fold axes, faults and joints, and fault-aligned streams. Drainage development in the study area responded noticeably to the underlying structure. The study raises questions with regard to the implications of one major or multiple dominant structural controls on drainage morphology and pattern. The findings have relevance with regard to the understanding fluvial drainage development and landform evolution in tectonically deformed regions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Neoproterozoic Hedmark Basin in the Caledonides of South Norway was formed at the western margin of the continent Baltica by rifting 750-600 Ma ago. The margin was destroyed in the Caledonian Orogeny and sedimentary basins translated eastwards. This study uses provenance analysis to map the crustal architecture of the pre-Caledonian SW Baltican margin. Conglomerate clasts and sandstones were sampled from submarine fan, alluvial fan and terrestrial glacigenic sedimentary rocks. Samples were analysed for U-Pb isotopes and clast samples additionally for Lu-Hf isotopes. The clasts are mainly granites c. 960 Ma and 1680 Ma old, coeval with the Sveconorwegian Orogeny and formation of the Palaeoproterozoic Transscandinavian Igneous Belt (TIB). Mesoproterozoic (Sveconorwegian) ages are abundant in the western part of the basin, whereas Palaeoproterozoic ages are common in the east. Lu-Hf isotopes support crustally contaminated source for all clasts linking them to Fennoscandia. Detrital zircon ages of the sandstones can be matched with those from the granitic clasts except for ages within the range 1200-1500 Ma. These ages are typically found in the present-day Telemark, SW Norway. The sandstones and conglomerate clasts in the western part of the Hedmark Basin were sourced from the Sveconorwegian domain in the present SW Norway or its continuation to the present-day NW. The conglomerate clasts in the eastern part of the Hedmark Basin were sourced mainly from the TIB domain or its northwesterly continuation. The Hedmark Basin was initiated within the boundary of two domains in the basement: the TIB and the Sveconorwegian domains.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>A thick Ordovician intra-rhyolitic palaeosol was studied to investigate the peculiarities of early Palaeozoic continental environments, shortly before the development of vascular plants, and to compare its pedogenic patterns with those of previously studied intra-basaltic profiles from the same succession. Well-defined K-eluviation from the top of the palaeosol is proportionally met by K-illuviation at the base of the profile, a pedogenic behaviour that was masked in the underlying intra-basaltic profiles due to subsequent eodiagenetic K-enrichment associated with rhyolite emplacement. Greater stability of K (and eventually Mg) than Si in the intra-rhyolitic profile suggests high pH soil water at the time of pedogenesis despite the low base contents of the acidic host rock, and despite evidence for humid weathering conditions. We also observe that, at the base and at the top of the profile, Al2O3/Zr ratios are substantially lower than those of the host rock, suggesting Al-leaching and therefore extreme weathering conditions, whereas the middle portion of the profile shows Al2O3/Zr ratios that are similar to those of the host rock, suggesting Al stability and therefore less extreme conditions. We interpret these variations in Al2O3/Zr ratios as signatures of a cyclic change from sub-humid periods during which Al was stable throughout the profile, to more humid periods with a well-defined seasonality, during which only the juvenile zone of weathering at the base of the profile could have developed sufficiently high pH during dry seasons for Al to be leached, leaving the Al2O3/Zr signatures from previous stages untouched higher in the profile.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Central Asian Orogenic Belt is an accretionary orogen with many distinct terranes including the Chinese Central Tianshan, whose Precambrian tectonic affinity is not yet clearly known. We present Precambrian age spectra of inherited/xenocrystic zircons from magmatic rocks in the Chinese Central Tianshan, collected from published papers. The age patterns are dominated by zircons with ages ranging from 3261 to 541 Ma. These spectra provide robust clues regarding the Precambrian affinity of the Chinese Central Tianshan. The age spectra record two major tectonothermal events, represented by salient age peaks of c. 950 and 900 Ma within the Grenville Orogeny' period, and age peaks at c. 750 and 630 Ma, synchronous with magmatic events corresponding to Rodinia break-up. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the Chinese Central Tianshan was part of the Tarim craton during Precambrian time as well as documenting its incorporation into, and separation from the Rodinia landmass.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Throughout historical and recent times, Alexandria has suffered great damage due to earthquakes from both near- and far-field sources. Sometimes, the sources of such damages are not well known. During the twentieth century, the city was shaken by several earthquakes generated from inland dislocations (e.g., 29 Apr. 1974, 12 Oct. 1992, and 28 Dec. 1999) and the African continental margin (e.g., 12 Sept. 1955 and 28 May 1998). Therefore, this study estimates the earthquake ground shaking and the consequent impacts in Alexandria on the basis of two earthquake scenarios. The simulation results show that Alexandria affected by both earthquakes scenarios relatively in the same manner despite the number of casualties during the first scenario (inland dislocation) is twice larger than the second one (African continental margin). An expected percentage of 2.27 from Alexandria's total constructions (12.9 millions, 2006 Census) will be affected, 0.19 % injuries and 0.01 % deaths of the total population (4.1 millions, 2006 Census) estimated by running the first scenario. The earthquake risk profile reveals that three districts (Al-Montazah, Al-Amriya, and Shark) lie in high seismic risks, two districts (Gharb and Wasat) are in moderate, and two districts (Al-Gomrok and Burg El-Arab) are in low seismic risk level. Moreover, the building damage estimations reflect that Al-Montazah is the highest vulnerable district whereas 73 % of expected damages were reported there. The undertaken analysis shows that the Alexandria urban area faces high risk. Informal areas and deteriorating buildings and infrastructure make the city particularly vulnerable to earthquake risks. For instance, more than 90 % of the estimated earthquake risks (buildings damages) are concentrated at the most densely populated (Al-Montazah, Al-Amriya, and Shark) districts. Moreover, about 75 % of casualties are in the same districts.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Sandwiched between the Dharwar Craton in the north and the Neoarchean-Proterozoic crustal blocks to the south, the Coorg Block in southern India is composed dominantly of a suite of arc magmatic rocks including charnockites, TTG (tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite)-related granitoid suite and felsic volcanic tuffs together with minor accreted oceanic remnants along the periphery of the block. Coeval mafic and felsic magmatism with magma mixing and mingling in an arc setting is well represented in the block. Here we present the petrology, geochemistry, zircon U-Pb geochronology and Lu-Hf isotopes of all the major lithologies from this block. Computation of metamorphic P-T conditions from mineral chemical data shows consistent granulite-facies P-T conditions of 820-870 degrees C and up to 6 kbar. Our geochemical data from major, trace and REE on representative samples of the dominant rock types from the Coorg Block corroborate an arc-related signature, with magma generation in a convergent margin setting. The zircon data yield weighted mean (207)pb/Pb-206 ages of 3153.4 +/- 9 to 3184.0 +/- 55 Ma for syenogranites, 31703 +/- 6.8 Ma for biotite granite, 3275 +/- 5.1 Ma for trondhjemite, 3133 +/- 12 to 3163.8 +/- 6.9 Ma for chamockites, 3156 +/- 10 to 3158.3 +/- 82 for mafic enclaves, 3161 +/- 16 Ma for diorite and 3173 16 Ma for felsic volcanic tuff. An upper intercept age of 3363 +/- 59 Ma and a lower intercept age of 2896 +/- 130 Ma on zircons from a charnockite, as well as an evaluation of the Th/U values of the zircon domains against respective Pb-207/Pb-206 ages suggest that the Mesoarchean magma emplacement which probably ranged from &gt;33 to 3.1 Ga was immediately followed by metamorphism at ca. 3.0 to 2.9 Ga. The ages of magmatic zircons from the chamockites and their mafic granulite enclaves, as well as those from the volcanic tuff and biotite granite, are all remarkably consistent and concordant marking ca. 3.1 Ga as the peak of subduction-related crust building in this block, within the tectonic milieu of an active convergent margin. The majority of zircons from the Coorg rocks show Hf isotope features typical of crystallization from magmas derived from juvenile sources. Their Hf crustal model ages suggest that the crust building might have also involved partial recycling of basement rocks as old as ca. 3.8 Ga. The crustal blocks in the Southern Granulite Terrane in India preserve strong imprints of major tectonothermal events at 25 Ga, 2.0 Ga, 0.8 Ga and 0.55 Ga associated with various subduction-accretion-collision or rifting events. However, the Coorg Block is exceptional with our data suggesting that none of the above events affected this block. Importantly, there is also no record in the Coorg Block for the 2.5 Ga pervasive regional metamorphism that affected all the other blocks in this region. The geochronological data raise the intriguing possibility that this block is an exotic entity within the dominantly Neoarchean collage in the northern domain of the Southern Granulite Terrane of India. The Mesoarchean arc-related rocks in the Coorg Block suggest that the magma factories and their tectonic architecture in the Early Earth were not markedly different from those associated with the modern-style plate tectonics.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Most of the geodynamic theories of deformation as well as metamorphism and melting of continental lithosphere are concentrated on plate boundaries and are dominated by the effects of subduction upon deformation of the margins of continental lithospheric blocks. However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that suture zones, or mobile belts, presumably representing fossil subduction zones, or other types of pre-deformation which occur far from present plate boundaries, play a key role in intra-continental deformation. In such zones, the crust is strongly sheared and the mantle lithosphere is metasomatized. Reworking of such settings reveals a surprisingly large range of instabilities that develop in compressed lithosphere with lateral heterogeneities inherited from previous deformational processes. Structural complexity arises, which is sensitive to lithospheric age and tectonic setting. This complexity influences localization of deformation, topographic evolution, melt generation, and melt generation, ascent and emplacement. In this paper, using fully coupled petrological-thermomechanical modeling, various tectonic responses are correlated with magmatic events in intra-continental settings and are compared to observed intra-cratonic orogenies and magmatic events.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Field, petrographic, geochemical and geochronological studies carried out in northwest Iberia constrain the nature and origin of the Ediacaran magmatic rocks cropping out in the Narcea Antiform. The results indicate the presence of a long-lived subduction-related magmatic arc between ca. 580 and ca. 560 Ma in two tectonic units. Magmatic rocks in the Allande Group are major intrusive calc-alkaline bodies and limited volcanic rocks. In the Eastern Navelgas Group, there are no intrusive bodies and volcanic rocks are widespread and represent large edifices exposed over tens of square km. Sm-Nd and Rb-Sr geochemical isotopic data indicate derivation of the magmatic rocks of both units from a ca. 1.1 Ga lithospheric mantle as well as varying degrees of crustal contamination. Geocronological U-Pb (LA-ICP-MS and ID-TIMS) data constrain the magmatic activity to 575-565 Ma in the Allande Group and to ca. 560 Ma in the Navelgas Group. Further constraints on the evolution of the magmatic arc have been obtained from the study of pebbles in early Cambrian conglomerates that were derived from the magmatic rocks of these Ediacaran units. We interpret these Ediacaran units to have been formed in a back-arc environment in the Narcea Antiform, and to record a multi-stage evolution along this segment of the northern Gondwana magmatic arc as revealed by their isotopic and geochronological differences.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>We present U-Pb-Hf isotopic and elemental data for granitoid intrusions formed during the early Permian in Eastern Tianshan (eastern part of Chinese Tianshan), with the aim of deciphering their magma sources and geodynamic evolution. These granitoids were formed at ca. 300-270 Ma and generally exhibit alkali-calcic to alkali compositions, and metaluminous and high-K calc-alkaline to shoshonitic characteristics. Commonly, steep REE patterns with significant enrichment of LREE relative to HREE showing (La/Yb)(CN) (4.4-43), distinctive negative Eu anomalies and depletion of Nb, Ta and Ti are noteworthy features of these granitoids, akin to the typical I-type granitoids implying an influx of mantle-derived magma. The tectonic setting of these granitoids in combination with the regional geology, suggests that the granitoids were generated in a post-collisional setting. The epsilon(Hf)(t) values from -10 to +14 (with four peaks at ca. -4, +5, +8.5 and +12) and T-DM(C) model ages (with four populations at ca. 1500, 970, 720 and 500 Ma) imply that the reworking of early Mesoproterozoic ancient crust related to Columbia and Neoproterozoic crust associated with Rodinia along with the early Permian input of juvenile material were variably sourced during the generation of the magmas studied herein. During the post-collisional process, the slab breakoff played a key role in the genesis of the granitoids and involved the reworking of ancient crust and mantle-derived sources, consistent with the Hf isotopic compositions.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Qinling Orogen was formed from the closure of the northernmost paleo-Tethys sea and the tectonic suturing of the Yangtze and North China Cratons. The timing of this collision and the tectonic framework are debated. The widely developed Triassic granitoids in the western Qinling Orogen offer a key to understand the tectonic evolution of this region. Here we compile the geological, geochemical and geochronological data of the Triassic granitoids from the Qingling Orogen and conclude that the granitoids north of the Mian-Lue Suture were emplaced in an active continental margin related to the northward subduction of the Mian-Lue oceanic plate during 248 - 200 Ma. The granitoids can be classified into I- and S-types, with the former constituting the major variety. Northward from the Mian-Lue Fault, an S-type granite belt appears, followed by and locally overlapping with an I-type granite belt. The I-type granite belt can be subdivided into four sub-belts from south to north, with increasing contents of K2O, K2O + Na2O, SiO2, Th and U, and the ratios of K2O/Na2O, Rb/Sr and (Sr-87/Sr-86)(i), but decreasing contents of Na2O, Al2O3, Mg#, and epsilon Hf(t), except for the northernmost belt which occurs in the Huaxiong Block of the North China Craton. This geochemical polarity of I-type granitoids and the zoned distribution of S- and I-types granitoids cannot be explained through continental collision orogeny (including syn- to post-collision), but can be well interpreted by considering the progressive subduction of the northernmost branch of the paleo-Tethys, as represented by the Mian-Lue Ocean. Thus, the termination of the northernmost paleo-Tethys and the onset of the continental collision between the Yangtze and the North China plates are considered to have occurred at about 200 Ma, during the transition from Triassic to Jurassic. Our model is also supported by the available data from other studies and provides a revised framework for the timing and tectonics of assembly of the Yangtze and the North China Cratons.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Yanliao rift zone along the northern margin of the North China Craton exposes a suite of volcanic rocks comprising trachybasalts and trachytes interlayered with dolostones in the Tuanshanzi Formation of the Changcheng Group. The overlying Dahongyu Formation is composed of olivine basalts, trachybasalts, trachyandesites, trachytes, and minor sub-alkaline basalts, intercalated with a lower sandstone and an upper dolostone sequence. LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb age data from the volcanics reveal that the Tuanshanzi Formation was deposited at ca. 1670 Ma, and the Dahongyu Formation at ca. 1625-1664 Ma Combined with previous studies, these new data indicate that the lowest boundary age of the Changcheng Group, marking the timing of initiation of the Yanliao rift, is ca. 1680 Ma. Except for the sub-alkaline basalts, the other alkaline volcanic rocks of the two formations are characterized by high Nb/Y ratios (1-3), and possess SiO2 contents of 433-60.5 wt.%, K2O of 0.72-15.69 wt.%, MgO of 0.10-8.56 wt.%, and with Mg# of 2-64. These rocks also display strongly fractionated REE patterns and generally positive Nb and Ta anomalies, with high (Nb/La)(PM) and (Nb/Th)(PM) values of 0.85-139 and 0.96-2.05, respectively. They show positive zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) values (+0.1 to +1.8 for the trachybasalt sample 11PG31-2) and whole-rock epsilon(Nd)(t) values (+ 0.83 to + 2.25). These geochemical features, together with trace element modeling, suggest that the alkaline volcanic rocks were generated by fractional crystallization of magma derived from low-degree partial melting of an OIB-like depleted asthenospheric mantle source, with only minor involvement of melts generated from the overlying enriched lithospheric mantle source. In contrast, the sub-alkaline basalts are characterized by low Nb/Y ratios of 0.09-0.19, and show fractionated REE patterns and pronounced negative Nb-Ta anomalies with low (Nb/La)pm and (Nb/Th)(PM) values of 0.07-0.21 and 0.10-033, respectively. In combination with the positive zircon epsilon(Hf)(t) values (+0.8-+43), we infer that these rocks were derived from the partial melting of a depleted lithospheric mantle source previously metasomatized by fluids from subducted slab. Combined with previous studies on the 1680-1780 Ma magmatic rocks along the northern margin of the NCC, our study identifies a late Paleoproterozoic asthenospheric upwelling in this region. The generation of the Yanliao rift and the eruption of these volcanic rocks were possibly triggered by the delamination of the continental lithosphere in a post-orogenic setting following the final amalgamation of the North China Craton within the Columbia supercontinent.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Balkhash-West Junggar remnant ocean is a conspicuous tectonic feature that had an important effect on the Paleozoic tectonic evolution of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt. How the Carboniferous Balkhash-West Junggar remnant ocean was filled and closed is poorly understood. In this study, we focus on the integrated tectonic-sedimentary evolution of the Tacheng Basin, which is located in the eastern part of the Balkhash-West Junggar remnant ocean, using high-resolution seismic reflection, well-line, geochronological and geochemical data to establish the filling of the basin by sediments and its evolution. The Carboniferous Balkhash-West Junggar remnant ocean basin was filled with Early Carboniferous deep marine mudstone and interbedded sandstone with minor andesite, basalt and tuff, and Late Carboniferous basalt, andesite, breccia and tuff and shallow marine mudstone and sandstone. The Carboniferous igneous assemblage mainly consists of basalt with high Nb content and (Nb/La)(PM) values and concomitant magnesian andesites with adakite geochemical characteristics of high Sr and low Y and Yb, suggesting a subduction-related tectonic setting. Zircons in the tuff that underlies the basalts and magnesian andesites were dated to ca. 315 Ma by LA-ICP-MS U-Pb. The identified unconformity between the Carboniferous and Lower Permian from seismic reflection profile in Well Tacan-1 subdivided the Carboniferous-Early Permian strata into two tectonostratigraphic units. The Lower Permian sequences overlap the Carboniferous strata and the facies transition from the submarine Carboniferous to the terrigenous Lower Permian indicates that the Balkhash-West Junggar remnant ocean closed during the Early Permian. These new data suggest that the sedimentary filling of the basin was in response to subduction and accretionary processes and that oceanic subduction was an important mechanism that led to the shrinking, filling and closure of the Balkhash-West Junggar remnant ocean because of compression. Therefore, lateral crust growth through subduction-accretionary processes still played an important role in the Carboniferous construction of western Junggar.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The U-Pb data from the volcanic and detrital zircon grains of the Tombador Formation in Chapada Diamantina, Bahia, provide the depositional age of the top of this unit and define the main sedimentary sources of the Archean, Paleoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic Eras. The lithofacies, petrographic and geochemical data from crystal-tuff samples indicated that a volcanic source was located to the east of the Chapada Diamantina region. The available zircon data defined three first-order intracratonic basinal cycles, including the Lower (Statherian), Middle (Calymmian) and Upper (Stenian-early Tonian) Espinhaco basins. These sequences are well exposed at the Espinhaco Supergroup type-section in the Chapada Diamantina region. The zircon Hf isotope data from the 1.4 Ga crystal-tuff in the Middle Espinhaco and the 12 Ga tuffaceous rock in the Upper Espinhaco suggested different sources, with model ages of 2.1 to 1.9 Ga and &lt;1.9 Ga, respectively. The tectonic development of these Paleoproterozoic to Mesoproterozoic intracratonic basins can be explained by the far-field stress at the paleoplate margins, which has been shown in other Phanerozoic intracratonic basins. The data presented here support a tectonic scenario in which the Congo-Sao Francisco paleoplate interior recorded the main global events related to the geodynamic processes after the Columbia supercontinent collage and the formation and fragmentation of the Rodinia supercontinent.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Kokchetav subduction-collision zone is located in the western part of the ancestral Central Asian Orogenic Belt. This zone is built up by the Precambrian Kokchetav microcontinent which includes a HP-UHP metamorphic belt, and the North Kokchetav tectonic zone (NKTZ) which represents an accretionary complex between the Kokchetav microcontinent and the adjacent Stepnyak island-arc. The entire region is widely intruded by Palaeozoic granitoids which were emplaced after the collision of the Stepnyak island-arc with the Kokchetav microcontinent. We present zircon U-Pb ages and Lu-Hf systematics in zircon to better characterize the tectonic evolution of the Kokchetav subduction-collision zone.
   <br>The Lu-Hf results indicate that the Kokchetav basement rocks are derived from late Neoarchaean - early Palaeoproterozoic (similar to 2.5 Ga) crust. For the granite-gneiss basement of the Kokchetav microcontinent, early Mesoproterozoic (Grenville-age, similar to 1.17-1.14 Ga) zircon U-Pb crystallization ages were obtained. For the NKTZ, two main age-components were recognized: (I) an oldest Mesoproterozoic age-component (similar to 1.20-1.05 Ga) similar as for the Kokchetav microcontinental zircons, and (2) a younger Early Cambrian (540-520 Ma) or Late Cambrian - Early Ordovician (similar to 490-480 Ma) age-component. Th/U ratios (&lt;0.1) are indicative of a metamorphic origin for both Early Cambrian and Late Cambrian - Early Ordovician zircon populations. The oscillatory zoned Mesoproterozoic zircons have higher Th/U ratios (&gt;0.1) and are typical of a magmatic protolith. The distinction between both zircon types is supported by characteristic cathodoluminescence images. These results confirm previous observations, indicating early Palaeozoic high-grade metamorphism (similar to 540-520 Ma) and collisional deformation (similar to 490-480 Ma) of the Mesoproterozoic Kokchetav zone as a result of subduction-accretion and collision of the Stepnyak island-arc to the Kokchetav microcontinent For two additional samples of the Balkashin granitic complex Early Devonian (similar to 415-395 Ma) zircon crystallization ages (magmatic Th/U ratios) were obtained. The occurrence of a Mesozoic xenocryst within these leucogranites may indicate that they were emplaced in a continental-arc setting. (C) 2013 International Association for Gondwana Research.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The ChahJam-Biarjmand complex (CJBC), flanked by the Alborz Mountains in the north and the Lut-Tabas block to the south, is part of Central Iranian block, where the oldest continental crust of Iran is found. This complex contains granitic to tonalitic orthogneissic rocks (old plutons) and associated metasediments, amphibolites and paragneisses. Metamorphosed granitic and granodioritic dikes intrude orthogneisses as well as metasediments and are abundant close to the plutons (orthogneissic rocks). Based on the results of bulk rock trace and rare earth elements, the orthogneissic rocks are inferred to have crystallized from subduction-related melts. Amphibolites also have subduction-related signatures and are inferred to have formed both as metamorphosed volcanoclastic sediments and as attenuated basic dikes. The presence of para-amphibolites associated with paragneisses and metasediments (mica schists) could represent a sedimentary basin filled with magmatic arc erosional products. U-Pb zircon dating of the ChahJam-Biarjmand rocks yielded U-238/Pb-206 crystallization ages of ca. 550 to 530 Ma (Ediacaran-early Cambrian). Sr-Nd isotope systematics on whole rocks (epsilon Nd(t) = -2.2 to -5.5) and zircon Hf isotope results indicate that CJBC Cadomian granitic rocks contain older, possible Mesoproterozoic, continental crust in their source. The ChahJam-Biarjmand granitic-tonalitic gneissic rocks are coeval with other similar-aged metagranites and gneisses within Iranian basement exposed in Central Iran, the Sanandaj-Sirjan Zone and the Alborz Mountains, as well as in the Tauride-Anatolide platform in western Anatolia and in NW Turkey. All these dispersed Cadomian basement rocks are interpreted to show fragments of Neoproterozoic-early Cambrian continental arcs bordering the northern active margin of Gondwana.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>We have mapped the locations of over 100,000 ice blocks across the south polar region of Saturn's moon Enceladus, thus generating the first quantitative estimates of ice-block number density distribution in relation to major geological features. Ice blocks were manually identified and mapped from twenty of the highest resolution (4-25 m per pixel) Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) narrow-angle images using ArcGIS software. The 10-100 m-diameter positive-relief features are marginally visible at the resolution of the images, making ice-block identifications difficult but not impossible. Our preliminary results reveal that ice blocks in the southern hemisphere are systematically most concentrated within the geologically active South Polar Terrain (SPT) and exhibit peak concentrations within 20 km of the tiger-stripe fractures as well as close to the south pole. We find that ice blocks are concentrated just as heavily between tiger-stripe fractures as on the directly adjacent margins; although significant local fluctuations in ice-block number density do occur, we observe no clear pattern with respect to the tiger stripes or jet sources. We examine possible roles of several mechanisms for ice-block origin, emplacement, and evolution: impact cratering, ejection from fissures during cryovolcanic eruptions, tectonic disruption of lithospheric ice, mass wasting, seismic disturbance, and vapor condensation around icy fumeroles. We conclude that impact cratering as well as mass wasting, perhaps triggered by seismic events, cannot account for a majority of ice-block features within the inner SPT. The pervasiveness of fracturing at many size scales, the ubiquity of ice blocks in the inner SPT, as well as the occurrence of linear block arrangements that parallel through-cutting crack networks along the flanks of tiger stripes indicate that tectonic deformation is an important source of blocky-ice features in the SPT. Ejection during catastrophic cryovolcanic eruptions and condensation around surface vents, however, cannot be ruled out. Further, sublimation processes likely erode and disaggregate ice blocks from solid exposures of ice, especially near the warm tiger-stripe fractures. The relative paucity of blocks beyond the bounds of the SPT, particularly on stratigraphically old cratered terrains, may be explained in part by mantling of the surface by fine particulate ice grains that accumulate over time.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The ubiquity of tectonic features formed in extension, and the apparent absence of ones formed in contraction, has led to the hypothesis that Ganymede has undergone global expansion in its past. Determining the magnitude of such expansion is challenging however, and extrapolation of locally or regionally inferred strains to global scales often results in strain estimates that exceed those based on global constraints. Here we use numerical simulations of groove terrain formation to develop a strain history for Ganymede that is generally consistent at local, regional, and global scales. These simulations reproduce groove-like amplitudes, wavelengths, and average slopes at modest regional extensions (10-15%). The modest strains are more consistent with global constraints on Ganymede's expansion. Yet locally, we also find that surface strains can be much larger (30-60%) in the same simulations, consistent with observations of highly-extended impact craters. Thus our simulations satisfy both the smallest-scale and largest-scale inferences of strain on Ganymede. The growth rate of the topography is consistent with (or exceeds) predictions of analytical models, and results from the use of a non-associated plastic rheology that naturally permits localization of brittle failure (plastic strain) into linear fault-like shear zones. These fault-like zones are organized into periodically-spaced graben-like structures with stepped, steeply-dipping faults. As in previous work, groove amplitudes and wavelengths depend on both the imposed heat flux and surface temperature, but because our brittle strength increases with depth, we find (for the parameters explored) that the growth rate of topography is initially faster for lower heat flows. We observe a transition to narrow rifting for higher heat flows and larger strains, which is a potential pathway for breakaway margin or band formation. Published by Elsevier Inc.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>On 19 May 2011, an earthquake of magnitude Mw:5.9 occurred just 9.1km below the surface of the earth on the Simav fault in Turkey. The region is located north-west of the Gediz graben, one of the major tectonic structures in the extensional regime of western Anatolia. In this study, from 2009 to 2011, the data from nine Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS-TR) in the region and one permanent Global Navigation Satellite System station working locally were assessed and analysed using GAMIT/GLOBK software. The behaviour of these stations before and after the earthquake was analysed using calculated time series. At the same time, the strain and rotation rates of current deformation in the Simav region were computed using the 2008-2011 data from the CORS-TR network. The directions obtained from the focal mechanism solutions and strain analysis of the Simav earthquake were observed as being in harmony. Nonetheless, Simav earthquake caused a displacement of 1-2mm (approximately) in nearby locations. The Simav earthquake shows that the extensional regime in western Anatolia has recently been active in the region and is a good example of the evolution of the graben system.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Zhongdian area in Yunnan, southwestern China, located at the southern end of the Yidun volcano-magmatic arc that was formed during the Triassic westward subduction of the Gaze-Litang Ocean, hosts numerous Triassic large porphyry and skarn deposits. The arc suffered Jurassic to Cretaceous arc-continental orogenic collision and Cenozoic intracontinental strike-slip shearing. The Hongshan Cu (-Mo-Pb-Zn) deposit is potentially a large deposit and contains two ore types: I) predominant layered skarn Cu-(Pb-Zn) ores along marble-hornfels contacts; and 2) minor crosscutting vein-type Cu-Mo mineralization. Previous research forwards a two-stage genetic model without sufficient dating evidence, supposing the skarn mineralization is related to the Triassic calc-alkalic intrusions and the vein-type mineralization related to Cretaceous quartz monzonite porphyries. Re-Os dating of molybdenite from vein-type ores and quartz monzonite porphyries and that of pyrrhotite from skarn ores are presented here to constrain the mineralization age and rebuild the genetic model. Analyses of eight molybdenite samples yield an isochron age of 79.7 +/- 3.1 Ma (MSWD = 9.2) for the vein-type mineralization and a model age of 81.9 +/- 1.1 Ma for the quartz monzonite porphyries. Isotope data on seven pyrrhotite samples from the skarn ores yield an isochron age of 79 +/- 16 Ma z(MSWD = 8.4). The Re-Os ages for the two ore types are concordant within analytical errors, indicating that the Hongshan deposit was formed in the Late Cretaceous. Elevated Re contents in molybdenite (13.65 to 63.91 mu g/g) and extremely radiogenic initial Os-187/Os-188 ratios in pyrrhotite (0.7673 to 0.8184; weighted average 0.796 +/- 0.038), together with elevated gamma(Os) values in pyrrhotite (507 to 547; average 528) imply a significant crustal component in the ore-forming materials that was likely derived from a lower crustal reservoir. Combined with the tectonic evolution of the Zhongdian area and geochemical characteristics of corresponding intrusions, the ages of mineralization obtained in this study indicate that the Hongshan deposit was formed in a post-collision setting with a genetic relationship to the emplacement of the quartz monzonite porphyry. These results provide significant new information for the study and exploration of the Late Cretaceous metallogeny in the Zhongdian area (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Almaden mine has been the largest among several mercury deposits that represent the biggest mercury concentration in the world. The deposits form a mining district which is located in a 30 km long and up to 15 km wide WNW-ESE oriented syncline, where a thick Lower Ordovician-Upper Devonian silicidastic sedimentary sequence outcrops. Most of the deposits are located in the south subvertical syncline flank, which has an opposite vergence to the rest of the region. Of special note is the presence of important NW-SE to WNW-ESE crustal structures that played a major role at several times during the regional geological history and controlled the sedimentary unit distribution, volcanism and deformation. One of these structures seems to have played an important role in the Almaden area, probably having been responsible for the anomalous syncline geometry. This structure acted during the E-W Variscan shortening as a ductile-fragile sinistral shear zone that resulted in a subvertical attitude of the southern Almaden Syncline flank, affecting the sedimentary sequence longitudinally. The Hg deposits in the region correspond to two types, stratabound and stockworks. The former are hosted in well-defined "Criadero Quartzite" orthoquartzite levels of Ordovician-Silurian age. These deposits were folded and sheared during the Variscan deformation. The stockwork deposits filled fractures and veins and partially replaced the volcanic rocks affected by the Variscan shear zones. The replacement process took place at the end of the E-W Variscan shortening
   <br>The Almaden deposit belongs to the stratabound type and has three mineralized levels, one located in the lower part and the other two in the upper part of the "Criadero Quartzite". Of minor relevance, other small stockwork bodies, replacing a volcanic breccia-tuff known as "Frailesca" rock, have also been exploited. This rock formed massive lenticular bodies that have been interpreted as pre-Variscan diatremes. On the basis of field criteria we conclude that the "Frailesca" rock emplacement took place later than cinnabar mineralization. After the "Frailesca" rock was formed, it was cut by sills of quartz-diabase that resulted from a new magmatic event. Both volcanic materials affect the mercury ore, developing small aureoles of contact metamorphism and volatilizing the cinnabar. The deposit shows three sectors, separated by two straight dextral faults, which cut the sinistral WNW-ESE shears bands. The latter affect the mercury ore, mostly in its western area.
   <br>Lead isotopes from Almaden cinnabar deposits show a broad range of values, higher than those predicted for the Stacey and Kramers and Cumming and Richards crustal Pb evolution models but largely tallying with the Sardinia evolution line for this sector of the Variscan basement quite well. The data set plotted along the Sardinia curve in several well defined clusters that could be interpreted as a lead extraction by means of large scale convective hydrothermal systems from a lead reservoir located in the upper crust at a time indicated by the Sardinia curve. The estimated ages for this lead model evolution indicate lead extraction as having occurred during the late Silurian-Devonian (420-375 Ma), late Variscan (300 Ma,), Permian-Triassic (290-220 Ma), late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous (200-150 Ma) and Eocene-Oligocene (50-25 Ma), and are coincident with the main extensional tectonic episodes (from late Ordovician to Devonian, Permian to Triassic and Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous). This shows that cinnabar is likely to have been mostly remobilized-crystallized during the regional extensional tectonic events, capturing lead from the host sedimentary sequence. This lead was mobilized by large scale, long term hydrothermal convective cells at various times, constituting a complex geotectonic history for the ore-forming processes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Zarigan-Chahmir basin is placed in the southern part of a crustal domain known as the Central Iranian microcontinent, at the northwestern margin of Gondwana. This basin hosts abundant mineral deposits, particularly of the iron oxide-apatite (IOA), Fe-Mn exhalative, and Zn-Pb sedimentary-exhalative (SEDEX) types. The evolution of this basin is governed by the Proto-Tethys oceanic crust subduction beneath the Central Iranian microcontinent and by the resulting continental arc and back-arc. This evolution followed two major stages of rifting: (I) Stage I or syn-rift phase, related to intra-basin extension, is indicated by coarse-grained detrital sedimentary rocks and bimodal volcanism (basis of the Early Cambrian Volcano-Sedimentary Sequence; ECVSS), which filled half-graben systems. During this stage, tuff-hosted stratiform, exhalative Fe-Mn deposits along with Kiruna-type IOA deposits formed. The former deposits (e.g., Narigan) are related to early submarine rhyolithic volcanism of the rift-phase sequence, whereas the latter (e.g., Esfordi, Choghart, Chadormalu, Chahgaz) are connected to hydrothermal activity directly linked to the arc calk-alkaline magmatism. (II) Stage II or sag-phase involved the deposition of calcareous shales, siltstones and carbonates (upper part of the ECVSS). Sedimentation during this phase was controlled by basin subsidence and by the reactivation of the half-graben faults. SEDEX deposits are hosted within a carbonaceous, black siltstone unit of the sag-phase sequence, which was deposited during a period of rapid basin subsidence and under anoxic conditions. The location of synsedimentary faults and the prevalence of poorly-oxygenated bottom water conditions were key factors controlling SEDEX mineralization processes in the basin. A high geothermal gradient caused by maximum syn-rift magmatism and sub-crustal lithospheric thinning, affecting primarily the center, western and northwestern basin, may have driven a basin-scale hydrothermal fluid circulation. This finding explains the occurrence of larger, well correlable SEDEX deposits in the northwestern and central parts of the Zarigan-Chahmir basin. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Ulu Sokor gold deposit is one of the most famous and largest gold deposits in Malaysia and is located in the Central Gold Belt. This deposit consists of three major orebodies that are related to NS- and NE-striking fractures within fault zones in Permian-Triassic meta-sedimentary and volcanic rocks of the East Malaya Block. The faulting events represent different episodes that are related to each orebody and are correlated well with the mineralogy and paragenesis. The gold mineralization consists of quartz-dominant vein systems with sulfides and carbonates. The hydrothermal alteration and mineralization occurred during three stages that were characterized by (I) silicification and brecciation; (II) carbonatization, sericitization, and chloritization; and (III) quartz-carbonate veins.
   <br>Fluid inclusions in the hydrothermal quartz and calcite of the three stages were studied. The primary CO2-CH4-H2O-NaCl fluid inclusions in stage I are mostly related to gold mineralization and display homogenization temperatures of 269-389 degrees C, salinities of 2.77-11.89 wt.% NaCl equivalent, variable CO2 contents (typically 5-29 mol%), and up to 15 mol% CH4. In stage II, gold was deposited at 235-398 degrees C from a CO2 +/- CH4-H2O-NaCl fluid with a salinity of 0.83-9.28 wt.% NaCl equivalent, variable CO2 contents (typically 5-63 mol%), and up to 4 mol% CH4. The delta(OH2O)-O-18 and delta D values of the ore-forming fluids from the stage II quartz veins are 4.5 to 4.8 parts per thousand and -44 to -42 parts per thousand, respectively, and indicate a metamorphic-hydrothermal origin. Oxygen fugacities calculated for the entire range of T-P-X-CO2 conditions yielded log f(O2) values between -28.95 and -36.73 for stage I and between -28.32 and -39.18 for stage II. These values indicate reduced conditions for these fluids, which are consistent with the mineral paragenesis, fluid inclusion compositions, and isotope values.
   <br>The presence of daughter mineral-bearing aqueous inclusions is interpreted to be a magmatic signature of stage IIIa. Combined with the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions (delta O-18(H2O) = 6.8 to 11.9 parts per thousand, delta D = -77 to -62%.), these inclusions indicate that the initial fluid was likely derived from a magmatic source. In stage IIIb, the gold was deposited at 263 to 347 degrees C from a CO2-CH4-H2O-NaCl fluid with a salinity of 533 to 11.05 wt.% NaCl equivalent, variable CO2 contents (typically 9-15 mol%), and little CH4. The oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions of this fluid (delta O-18(H2O) = 8.1 to 8.8 parts per thousand, delta D = -44 to -32 parts per thousand) indicate that it was mainly derived from a metamorphic-hydrothermal source. The CO2-H2O CH4-NaCl fluids that were responsible for gold deposition in the stage IIIc veins had a wide range of temperatures (214-483 degrees C), salinities of 1.02 to 21.34 wt.% NaCl equivalent, variable CO2 contents (typically 4-53 mol%), and up to 7 mol% CH4. The oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions (delta O-18(H2O) = 8.5 to 9.8 parts per thousand, delta D = -70 to -58 parts per thousand) were probably acquired at the site of deposition by mixing of the metamorphic-hydrothermal fluid with deep-seated magmatic water and then evolved by degassing at the site of deposition during mineralization. The log f(O2), values from -28.26 to -35.51 also indicate reduced conditions for this fluid in stage IIIc. Moreover, this fluid had a near-neutral pH and delta S-34 values of H2S of -232 to 0.83 parts per thousand, which may reflect the derivation of sulfur from the subducted oceanic lithospheric materials.
   <br>The three orebodies represent different gold transportation and precipitation models, and the conditions of ore formation are related to distinct events of hydrothermal alteration and gold mineralization. The gold mineralization of the Ulu Sokor deposit occurred in response to complex and concurrent processes involving fluid immiscibility, fluid-rock reactions, and fluid mixing. However, fluid immiscibility was the most important mechanism for gold deposition and occurred in these orebodies, which have corresponding fluid properties, structural controls, geologic characteristics, tectonic settings, and origins of the ore-forming matter. These characteristics of the Ulu Sokor deposit are consistent with its classification as an orogenic gold deposit, while some of the veins are genetically related to intrusions.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>study documents the geochemistry of sulfide ores of the Tudun Cu-Ni sulfide deposit located at the western end of the Huangshan-Jing'erquan ore belt in the northern part of eastern Tianshan. The ores have been classified as (1) disseminated sulfide ores, (2) net-textured sulfide ores, and (3) massive sulfide ores. The geochemistry of barren rocks shows Ni and Cu contents ranged 889-1330 ppm and 145-253 ppm, respectively. The rocks generally contained similar to 0.10 ppb Rh, Ir, Ru and Os, and similar to 1 ppb Pt and Pd, as well as high Cu/Pd ratios (133-246). The contents of Cu, Ni and PGEs in sulfide ores were calculated on a 100% sulfide basis. Total PGEs on a 100% sulfide basis ranged from 13.2 ppb to 443 ppb (average = 144 ppb), which were lower than the values in the Huangshandong deposit (average = 186 ppb) in the eastern Tianshan ore belt, one order of magnitude lower than the Jinchuan deposit, and two orders of magnitude lower than the Noril'sk-Talnakh deposit. The R factor value ranged from 168 to 1810 in sulfide ores of the Tudun deposit indicating Cu and Ni enrichment, although PGEs enrichment did not reach recoverable grades.
   <br>In the Tudun deposit the Pd/Ir ratio of sulfide ores was less than 100, showing weak hydrothermal fluid alteration. The massive sulfide ores exhibited less primitive mantle-normalized PGEs patterns, which are depleted in PPGEs and different from PPGEs-rich intrusions, as well as disseminated and net-textured sulfide ores. In addition, the massive sulfide ores exhibit a strong negative Pt anomaly. This may be due to fractionation of Pt-Fe alloys in the magma batches prior to its intrusion into the staging chamber. It could also be caused by selective Pt leaching from the sulfides by hydrothermal fluids during remobilization within the Tudun chamber. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Tantalum, an important metal for high-technology applications, is recovered from oxide minerals that are present as minor constituents in rare-metal granites and granitic rare-element pegmatites. Columbite-group minerals (CGM) account for the majority of the current tantalum production; other Ta-Nb oxides (TNO) such as tapiolite, wodginite, ixiolite, rutile and pyrochlore-supergroup minerals may also be used.
   <br>In this paper mineralogical and geochemical data with a focus on opaque minerals as well as age determinations on CGM using the U-Pb method are presented for 13 rare-element granite and pegmatite districts in Africa, covering Archean, Paleoproterozoic, Neoproterozoic, Paleozoic and Mesozoic provinces. Geological, economic and geochronological data are reviewed.
   <br>Each period of Ta-ore formation is characterised by peculiar mineralogical and geochemical features that assist in discriminating these provinces. Compositions of CGM are extremely variable: Fe-rich types predominate in the Man Shield (Sierra Leone), the Congo Craton (Democratic Republic of the Congo), the Kamativi Belt (Zimbabwe) and the Jos Plateau (Nigeria). Mn-rich columbite-tantalite is typical of the Alto Ligonha Province (Mozambique), the Arabian-Nubian Shield and the Tantalite Valley pegmatites (southern Namibia). Large compositional variations through Fe-Mn fractionation, followed by Nb-Ta fractionation are typical for pegmatites of the Kibara Belt of Central Africa, pegmatites associated with the Older Granites of Nigeria and some pegmatites in the Damara Belt of Namibia. CGM, tapiolite, wodginite and ixiolite accommodate minor and trace elements at the sub-ppm to weight-percent level. Trace elements are incorporated in TNO in a systematic fashion, e.g. wodginite and ixiolite carry higher Ti, Zr, Hf, Sn and Li concentrations than CGM and tapiolite. Compared to tapiolite, CGM have higher concentrations of all trace elements except Hf and occasionally Zr, Ti, Sn and Mg. The composition of TNO related to rare-element pegmatites is rather different from rare-metal granites: the latter have high REE and Th concentrations, and low Li and Mg. Pegmatite-hosted TNO are highly variable in composition, with types poor in REE, typical of LCT-family pegmatites, and types rich in REE - showing affinity for NYF-family or mixed LCT-NYF pegmatites. Major and trace elements show regional characteristics that are conspicuous in normalised trace element and REE diagrams. In general, CGM from Ta-ore provinces are characterised by the predominance of one type of REE distribution pattern characterised by ratios between individual groups of REE (light, middle, heavy REE) and the presence and intensity of anomalies (e.g. Eu/Eu*).
   <br>Despite textural complexities such as complex zoning patterns and multiple mineralisation stages, the chemical compositions of CGM, tapiolite and wodginite-ixiolite from rare-metal granite and rare-element pegmatite provinces indicate that they are cogenetic and reflect specific source characteristics that may be used to discriminate among rocks of different origin.
   <br>Geochronological data produced for CGM from ore districts are discussed together with the respective ore mineralogy and minor and trace element geochemistry of TNO to reconsider the geodynamics of pegmatite formation. In Africa, formation of rare element-bearing pegmatites and granites is related to syn- to late-orogenic (e.g., West African Craton, Zimbabwe Craton), post-orogenic (Kibara Belt, Damara Belt, Older Granites of Nigeria, Adola Belt of Ethiopia) and anorogenic (Younger Granites of Nigeria) tectonic and magmatic episodes. The late-orogenic TNO mineralisation associated with A-type granites in the Eastern Desert of Egypt shares geochemical features with the anorogenic Younger Granites of Nigeria. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Huanglongpu carbonatite-related Mo ore field is located in the Lesser Qinling Orogenic belt in the southern margin of the North China block. The ore field is composed of six deposits, Yuantou, Wengongling, Dashigou, Shijiawan, Taoyuan and Erdaohe, all of which are genetically related to carbonatite dykes except for the Shijiawan deposit which is associated with a granitic porphyry. The Yuantou carbonatite dykes intruded into Archean gneiss and other carbonatites emplaced into Mesoproterozoic volcanic and sediment rocks. The carbonatites are mainly composed of calcite and variable amounts of quartz and K-feldspar and minor molybdenite. Re-Os dating of molybdenite from the Yuantou carbonatite yields a weighted average age of 225.0 +/- 7.6 Ma, consistent with the molybdenite age (221 Ma) from the Dashigou deposit. The rocks are characterized by high heavy REE (HREE) contents and consistent flat REE distribution patterns with La/Yb-cn similar to 1. Quartz in the carbonatites from Yuantou and Dashigou deposits shows consistent 0 isotopes (8.1-10.2%.) similar to the associated calcite (7.2-9.5%.). The quartz and associated K-feldspar contain lower Zr, Hf and higher HREE abundances and negligible Eu anomaly relative to those from the granite porphyry in Shijiawan. Both minerals are primary products in the carbonatitic liquid, and not captured from the wall-rocks or crustal-derived silicate magmas, or a hydrothermal origin. Thus, the Huanglongpu carbonatitic liquids were enriched in Si and Mo, which may be produced by intensely fractional crystallization of non-silicate minerals. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Previously generated phylogenetic hypotheses were converted into area cladograms, ancestral geographic ranges were optimized and speciation events characterized as via dispersal or vicariance, when possible. Area relationships were reconstructed using Lieberman-modified Brooks Parsimony Analysis. The resulting area cladograms indicate tectonic and oceanographic changes were the primary geologic drivers of biogeographic patterns within the focal taxa. The Taconic tectophase contributed to the separation of the Appalachian and Central basins as well as the two midcontinent basins, whereas sea level rise following the Boda Event promoted interbasinal dispersal. Three migration pathways into the Cincinnati Basin were recognized, which supports the multiple pathway hypothesis for the Richmondian Invasion.</td>

Great fluctuations in mean grain size in the sections of the Pirgu (uppermost Katian) and Porkuni (Hirnantian) stages are considered as indications of eustatic sea level fluctuations, pointing to the glaciation in the Hirnantian and its prelude in Pirgu time. An alternative cause of grain size fluctuations might be the up-and-down tectonic movements. Nevertheless, the synchronicity of cessation of fluctuations with the end of the Hirnantian glaciation supports the glaciation-related reasons.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In a volcanic area, the orientation and composition of dikes record the development of the magmatic system that feeds intrusive and eruptive activity. At Spanish Peaks, Colorado, curved dike trajectories issuing from a single focal area have been attributed to horizontal propagation from a pressurized central reservoir in a deviatoric tectonic stress field. These dikes, however, are nowhere in contact with the central intrusion, are younger than it by about 1 My and are not filled with the same magma. They were emplaced at shallow depths (approximate to 1 km), where the local stress field is very sensitive to surface loads. Here, we show that their trajectories can be set by the load of a volcanic edifice in a tectonic stress field. The orientation and distribution of the Spanish Peaks dikes have changed in the course of two million years as magmas were evolving chemically. Early dikes that were parallel to each another and filled with primitive melts document ascent in the regional tectonic stress field. They were replaced by curved dikes carrying evolved melts, which record the influence of a sizable volcanic edifice. Beneath this edifice, the induced compression prevented dense primitive magmas from erupting in the focal area and diverted intermediate magmas sideways. The growth of this large volcanic cone was probably responsible for the formation of a magma reservoir. The mechanisms that have shaped the Spanish Peaks dike swarm may control the spatial distribution and migration of eruptive centers in many active volcanic areas. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The mechanics of slip on low-angle normal faults (LANFs) remain an enduring problem in structural geology and fault mechanics. In most cases, new faults should form rather than having slip occur on LANFs, assuming values of fault friction consistent with Byerlee's Law. We present results of laboratory measurements on the frictional properties of natural clay-rich gouges from low-angle normal faults (LANF) in the American Cordillera, from the Whipple Mts. Detachment, the Panamint range-front detachment, and the Waterman Hills detachment. These clay-rich gouges are dominated by neoformed clay minerals and are an integral part of fault zones in many LANFs, yet their frictional properties under in situ conditions remain relatively unknown. We conducted measurements under saturated and controlled pore pressure conditions at effective normal stresses ranging from 20 to 60 MPa (corresponding to depths of 0.9-2.9 km), on both powdered and intact wafers of fault rock. For the Whipple Mountains detachment, friction coefficient (mu) varies depending on clast content, with values ranging from 0.40 to 0.58 for clast-rich material, and 0.29-0.30 for clay-rich gouge. Samples from the Panamint range-front detachment were clay-rich, and exhibit friction values of 0.28 to 0.38, significantly lower than reported from previous studies on fault gouges tested under room humidity (nominally dry) conditions, including samples from the same exposure. Samples from the Waterman Hills detachment are slightly stronger, with mu ranging from 0.38 to 0.43. The neoformed gouge materials from all three localities exhibits velocity-strengthening frictional behavior under almost all of the experimental conditions we explored, with values of the friction rate parameter (a-b) ranging from 0.001 to +0.025. Clast-rich samples exhibited frictional healing (strength increases with hold time), whereas clay-rich samples do not. Our results indicate that where clay-rich neoformed gouges are present along LANFs, they provide a mechanically viable explanation for slip on faults with dips &lt;20 degrees, requiring only moderate (P-f &lt; sigma(3)) overpressures and/or correcting for similar to 5 degrees of footwall tilting. Furthermore, the low rates of frictional strength recovery and velocity-strengthening frictional behavior we observe provide an explanation for the lack of observed seismicity on these structures. We suggest that LANFs in the upper crust (depth &lt;8 km) slip via a combination of a) reaction-weakening of initially high-angle fault zones by the formation of neoformed clay-rich gouges, and b) regional tectonic accommodation of rotating fault blocks.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Arabian Shield preserves a protracted magmatic record of amalgamated juvenile terranes that host a diverse range of early Neoproterozoic to Cambrian granitoids intruding volcanosedimentary basin assemblages that have corollaries in other parts of the East African Orogen. New zircon U-Pb geochronology of 19 granitoids intruding eight Arabian Shield terranes, define four discrete magmatic events: island arc (similar to 845 Ma), syncollisional (similar to 710 Ma), post-tectonic (similar to 620 Ma) and anorogenic (similar to 525 Ma). Zircon Lu-Hf isotopic analyses indicate that all studied granitoids are juvenile with typical epsilon Hf values of &gt;+5 to +10 and Stenian-Tonian (similar to 1100-900 Ma) model ages, regardless of their precise intrusive ages or spatial relationship. Subtle changes in isotopic signatures between 850 and 600 Ma, suggest the result from changes in granite source materials brought about by; basaltic underplating, limited crustal interaction with Palaeoproterozoic basement and a change to lithospheric delamination/subduction roll-back processes driving juvenile ANS crustal growth.
   <br>The cycle of granite intrusion reflects accretionary cycles initiated during Mozambique Ocean closure and during Gondwana amalgamation and final assembly. Post-tectonic magmatism is divided into a similar to 636-600 Ma phase and post 600 Ma event that reflects first subduction and then within-plate related processes. The identification of magmatism at similar to 525 Ma is now the youngest granitoid identified so far in the Saudi Arabian Shield and may change the identified age of the regional, basal Palaeozoic unconformity. This late magmatism may be generated by the Najd Fault reactivation correlating with the Malagasy/Kunnga Orogeny that marked the final stages of Gondwana assembly. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The extent to which heat recorded in orogens reflects thermal conditions inherited from previous rift-related processes is still debated and poorly documented. As a case study, we examine the Mauleon basin in the north-western Pyrenees that experienced both extreme crustal thinning and tectonic inversion within a period of similar to 30 Myrs. To constrain the time-temperature history of the basin in such a scenario, we provide new detrital zircon fission-track and (U-Th-Sm)/He thermochronology data. The role of rift-related processes in subsequent collision is captured by inverse modeling of our thermochronological data, using relationships between zircon (U-Th-Sm)/He ages and uranium content, combined with thermo-kinematic models of a rift-orogen cycle. We show that the basin recorded significant heating at about 100 Ma characterized by high geothermal gradients (similar to 80 degrees C/km). Our thermo-kinematic modeling and geological constraints support the view that subcontinental lithospheric mantle was exhumed at that time below the Mauleon basin. Such a high geothermal gradient lasted 30 Myr after onset of convergence at similar to 83 Ma and was relaxed during the collision phase from similar to 50 Ma. This study suggests that heat needed for ductile shortening during convergence, is primarily inherited from extension rather than being only related to tectonic and/or sedimentary burial. This should have strong implications on tectonic reconstructions in many collision belts that resulted from inversion of hyper-extended rift basins. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Tibetan Plateau is formed by continuing convergence between Indian and Asian plates since similar to 50 Ma, involving more than 1400 km of crustal shortening. New seismic data from western Tibet (the TW-80 experiment at 80 degrees E) reveal segmentation of lower crustal structure by the major sutures, contradicting the idea of a mobile lower crust that flows laterally in response to stress variations. Significant changes in crustal structure and Moho depth occur at the mapped major tectonic boundaries, suggesting that zones of localized shear on sub-vertical planes extend through the crust and into the upper mantle. Converted waves originating at the Moho and at a shallower discontinuity are interpreted to define a partially eclogitized layer that extends 200 km north of the Indus-Yarlung Suture Zone, beneath the entire Lhasa block at depths of between 50 and 70 km. This layer is thinner and shallower to the north of the Shiquanhe Fault which separates the northern Lhasa block from the southern part, and the degree of eclogitization is interpreted to increase northward. The segmentation of the Tibetan crust is compatible with a shortening deformation rather than shear on horizontal planes. Unless the Indian-plate mantle lithosphere plunges steeply into the mantle beneath the Indus-Yarlung suture, leaving Indian-plate crust accreted to the southern margin of Tibet, then it too must have experienced a similar shortening deformation.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In order to clarify sedimentary environment and tectonic history of the Sulu orogenic belt, we date zircons from four sandstones and one interbedded rhyolite collected on Lingshan Island in East Shandong, North China. U-Pb age distributions of detrital zircon populations from the newly named Lingshandao Formation resemble that of overlying fluvial sedimentary rocks. Age distributions exhibit four main populations of Paleoproterozoic (2.5-2.3 Ga), Mesoproterozoic (2.1-1.9 Ga), Neoproterozoic (850-700 Ma) and Early Cretaceous (138-121 Ma) age, accompanied by sporadic occurrences of Archean, Paleozoic and early Mesozoic aged grains. Data indicate a depositional age of similar to 121 Ma for the Lingshandao Formation, which constrains the maximum depositional age of overlying fluvial sedimentary rocks. The Lingshandao Formation thus more likely correlates to the uppermost Laiyang Group of the Jiaolai basin. Proterozoic age populations indicate a mixture of material derived from the North China (NCB) and Yangtze Block (YZB) basement along with protolith material from the HP-UHP metamorphic units of the Sulu orogenic belt. Proterozoic age populations differ from those of the roughly coeval Jiaolai basin, which represents a terrestrial depositional environment to the north of the Sulu terrane. The YZB appears to be a significant source of detrital zircons, consistent with field observations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Altai-Mongolian terrane (AM) is a key component of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB), but its tectonic nature has been poorly constrained. This paper reports geochemical compositions of CambrianOrdovician meta-sedimentary rocks from the northern AM to trace their source nature and depositional setting, which in turn place constraints on the geodynamic evolution of the AM.
   <br>The CambrianOrdovician meta-sedimentary rocks from the northern AM show variable major-element compositions, with negative correlation between SiO2 and TiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3T, MgO and K2O. Their high ICV values (1.18-2.53) and relatively low CIA values (37.9-76.3) indicate that the sediments were immature and probably underwent mild to moderate chemical weathering. The low-SiO2 samples are characterized by relatively restricted SiO2/Al2O3 (mostly 2.60-6.07) and low Rb/Sr ratios (0.02-1.89), implying their proximal deposition without obvious sedimentary sorting and recycling. In contrast, the high-SiO2 samples show much higher SiO2/Al2O3 ratios (15.4-19.9) possibly due to sedimentary sorting and/or silicification. All these samples yield relatively high Al2O3/TiO2 ratios (15.6-22.8), strong LREEs/HREEs differentiation ((La/Yb)N = 4.86-10.7) and obvious negative Eu anomalies (delta Eu = 0.61-0.83). Combined with their Th/Sc, Zr/Sc, La/Th and Co/Th ratios comparable with intermediate-acidic magmatic rocks, we infer that these kinds of magmatic rocks served as a major source for the investigated meta-sedimentary rocks. The TiO2, Al2O3 and Fe2O3T + MgO concentrations are mostly higher than typical sediments from passive margin, and the Th/U, La/Sc, Th/Sc, Eu/Eu*, Zr/Hf, Zr/Th and La/Th ratios are quite similar to sediments from continental arcs. These data suggest that the CambrianOrdovician meta-sedimentary rocks from the northern AM were most likely deposited in an environment related to a continental arc setting rather than a passive regime. These rocks show strong similarities to their counterparts in the Chinese Altai (CA, southern AM) and Tseel terrane (southeastern extension of the CA in western Mongolia) in terms of geochemical compositions and depositional setting. With combination of recent isotopic studies for detrital zircons, our data suggest that the AM probably represented a coherent accretionary prism along a continental arc in the early Paleozoic.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Numerous small dismembered ophiolite fragments occur in South Mongolia, but they are very poorly studied. The lack of age data and geochemical analysis hampers our understanding of the Paleozoic tectonic evolution of the region. We conducted detailed studies on the Manlay ophiolitic complex and Huree volcanic rocks south of the Main Mongolian Lineament (MML) to provide some constraints on these rocks. The Manlay ophiolite consists of dunite, harzburgite, pyroxenite, gabbro, plagiogranite, basalt and chert, locally with chromite mineralization in dunite. The gabbro and plagiogranite yielded SHRIMP zircon weighted mean Pb-206/U-238 ages of 509 +/- 5 Ma and 482 +/- 4 Ma, respectively. The basalt and dolerite samples of this complex show enrichment in LREE and LILE and negative Nb, Ta and Ti anomalies, and the chrome spinel from the chromitite lens in the dunite is characterized by high Cr-# and low TiO2 contents. These features suggest a supra-subduction zone (SSZ) origin for the ophiolitic complex. The Huree volcanic rocks, ranging from basalt to dacite, display enrichment in LREE and LILE, weak Eu anomalies and distinctly negative Nb, Ta and Ti anomalies, consistent with those of typical magmas in a subduction environment. An andesite sample from this arc yielded a SHRIMP (206)pb/U-238 zircon age of 487 +/- 5 Ma, which is the oldest reliable age for an island arc in South Mongolia. Recognition of an Early Paleozoic ophiolitic complex and a coeval island arc indicates that South Mongolia underwent a period of active volcanism during Late Cambrian to Ordovician. Additionally, the tuff overlying the ophiolitic complex and a granite intruding the ophiolite have SHRIMP zircon U-Pb ages of 391 +/- 5 Ma and 304 +/- 4 Ma, respectively. Combining the available data, we propose that the Early Paleozoic subduction accretionary complexes likely constitute the basement of the Late-Paleozoic arc formations and correlate with the Lake Zone in western Mongolia.

Intra-platform tectonic and sedimentary characteristics indicate a clear linkage to the tectonic evolution of the basin margin during early Paleozoic time. During the Cambrian, small intra-platform rift-related depressions formed during an extensional setting. During the Mid-Early Ordovician, a transition from extension to compression caused formation of the Tazhong and Tabei paleo-uplifts and major unconformities T-7(4) (base of the Late Ordovician). The evolving paleo-geomorphology led to differentiation of sedimentary facies, and numerous intra-platform shoals formed during deposition of the Early Ordovician Yingshan Formation. During the Late Ordovician, regional compression began, which changed the platform margin slopes into four slopes that surrounded the three isolated island uplifts of Tabei, Tazhong, and Tangnan in the Late Ordovician. Simultaneously, the basin margin dynamic conditions also changed the relative sea level and filling pattern of the basin. In the Early and Middle Cambrian, the Tarim Basin mainly developed a progradational ramp-type platform due to relative sea level fall. From the Late Cambrian to Early Ordovician the relative sea level began to rise, resulting in an aggradational-retrograding rimmed margins-type platform. In the Late Ordovician, along with a further rise in relative sea level, the basin mainly developed isolated platform. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</td>

Here we use the H-k stacking technique and neighborhood algorithm to investigate the seismic structure of this area. Based on the presence of felsic lower crust and the Mesozoic crustal architecture of the Songpan-Ganzi and Longmenshan area, we exclude the model on the eastward flow of the middle and lower crust assigned as the cause for the crustal thickening in previous studies. In contrast, the E-W trending cumulative compression induced by the continued northward motion of the Indian plate and India-Asian collision are identified as the dominant factors leading to the crustal thickening in the Longmenshan thrust-fault region as well as the Songpan-Ganzi terrane. Particularly, the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan and 2013 Ms 7.0 Lushan earthquakes likely indicate the cumulative offsets and the E-W continuing compression. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The late Permian-Triassic granites in southeastern China have important tectonic significance for the evolution of East Asia. A detailed study utilizing zircon U-Pb dating, major and trace element geochemistry, and zircon Hf isotope geochemistry for Dashuang and Jingju granites in Zhejiang Province, South China was performed. LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb analyses yielded ages of quartz-monzonite and monzogranite that are 234 +/- 3 Ma and 231 +/- 3 Ma, respectively, from the Dashuang pluton, while the LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb ages of monzogranite and K-feldspar granite from the Jingju pluton are 246 2 Ma and 241 3 Ma, respectively. These ages indicate that the magmatism event took place during the early Triassic to Mid-Triassic. The two granites have high contents of total alkalis (Na2O + K2O = 7.73-10.24%), high-field-strength elements (e.g., Zr = 215-471 ppm, Y = 25.8-36.5 ppm, Nb = 15-28 ppm, and Zr + Nb + Ce + Y = 293-849 ppm) and rare earth elements (total REE = 299-701 ppm), as well as high Ga/Al ratios (10,000 x Ga/Al = 2.44-2.9). The zircon saturation temperatures were 800-837 degrees C for the two granites, which suggests that they have the petrographic and geochemical characteristics of A-type granites. In-situ Hf isotopic analyses revealed that the two granites have epsilon(Hf)(t) values ranging from -20 to -6 and two-stage depleted mantle Hf model ages from 1.6 Ga to 2.6 Ga, which indicate that the two granite magmas were formed by the partial melting of Paleoproterozoic crust rocks in the Cathaysia Block. A series of A-type granites distributed in the coastal region probably defines an extensional environment in the early Triassic. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In the early Paleozoic the Sino-Korean Craton (SKC) and South China Craton (SCC) were situated along the margin of east Gondwana. The SKC was connected to core Gondwana by an epeiric sea which was the site for deposition of lower Paleozoic sequences of SKC. The SKC and SCC may have drifted away from core Gondwana sometime during the mid-Paleozoic and would have been outboard microcontinents in the late Paleozoic, until they collided to form the East Asian continent in the Triassic. The breakup of SCC from Gondwana was suggested to have taken place at similar to 380 Ma, while no reliable suggestions have hitherto been made for breakup of SKC from Gondwana. This study presents a convincing evidence for breakup of SKC from Gondwana, based on the recognition of Late Ordovician volcanism in Korea. New SHRIMP U-Pb zircon ages, 445.0 +/- 3.7 Ma and 452.5 +/- 3.2 Ma, are obtained from trachytic rocks of the Ongnyeobong Formation of Taebaeksan Basin in Korea which occupied the marginal part of the SKC in the early Paleozoic. This Late Ordovician volcanism along with previous records of Ordovician volcanic activities along the western margin of the SKC is interpreted indicating the development of an incipient oceanic ridge. The oceanic ridge uplifted the SKC including the epeiric sea, which subsequently resulted in terminating the early Paleozoic sedimentation of the epeiric sea. The paucity of lower Paleozoic volcanic rocks across much of the SKC however suggests that the oceanic ridge did not extend into the epeiric sea. Instead, spreading of oceanic ridge entailed dextral movement of associated transform faults, which may have played a major role in breakup of SKC from mainland Gondwana by the end of Ordovician.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>To constrain the provenance of the Ordos Basin and the evolution history of the Qinling Orogen Belt from the Triassic to the Jurassic, 10 samples from the Dongsheng area and 28 samples from the Yan'an area were analyzed for U-Pb ages and Lu-Hf and Sm-Nd isotopic compositions. The results indicate that Middle Jurassic sediments in the Dongsheng area were derived from the Khondalite Belt, Langshan Mountain and the Yinshan Terrane. Mesozoic sediments in the Yan'an area consist of two parts. One part is derived from the North China Craton (NCC), which has U-Pb age groups of similar to 1.8 Ga and similar to 2.5 Ga, and Hf model ages of similar to 2.8 Ga. The other part is derived from the Qilian-Qinling Orogenic Belt, which has U-Pb age groups of 600-1500 Ma and 100-500 Ma, and Nd and Hf isotopic model ages of less than 2.2 Ga. Combining the U-Pb ages with the Hf and Nd isotopic model ages, Mesozoic detrital zircons with U-Pb age groups of similar to 1.8 Ga and similar to 2.5 Ga in the Yan'an area are found to also be derived from the Khondalite Belt, Langshan Mountain and the Yinshan Terrane, not from the Trans-China Orogen Belt. From the late-Late Triassic sediments of the Yan'an area, the low average values of the Hf (2.03 Ga) and Nd (2.03 Ga) model ages and the chatacteristic age population of 600-1500 Ma reveal that the main collision or continental subduction between the NCC and the South China Craton (SCC) occurred in the late-Late Triassic. After the main collision or continental subduction, the proportion of sediments from the Qinling-Qilian Orogenic Belt began to decrease (recorded in the early Jurassic samples), which may be in response to the gradual slowing of the uplift speed of the Qinling Orogenic Belt. In the early-middle Jurassic, the sediments have a main U-Pb age population of 100-500 Ma, low detrital zircon Hf model ages (average value is 1.17 Ga) and low whole rock Nd model ages (average value is 1.13 Ga), which suggests that the Qilian-Qinling Orogenic Belt may have a fast uplift history in the early-middle Jurassic.

Tectono-thermal history is widely thought to be important to understand tectonics as well as oil and gas potential of basin. la order to investigate the Cenozoic tectono-thermal history of the Reed Bank Basin, we carried out thermal modeling on one drill well and 22 pseudo-wells using the multi-stage finite stretching model. Two stages of rifting during the time peri6ds of similar to 65.5-40.4 Ma and similar to 40.4-28.4 Ma can be recognized from the tectonic subsidence rates, and there are two phases of heating corresponding to the rifting. The reconstructed average basal paleo-heat flow values at the end of the rifting events are 60 and 66.3 mW/m(2), respectively. Following the heating periods, this basin has undergone a persistent thermal attenuation phase since similar to 28.4 Ma and the basal heat flow cooled down to similar to 57.8-63.5 mW/m(2) at present. In combination with the radiogenic heat production of the sedimentary sequences, the surface heat flow of the Reed Bank Basin ranges from similar to 60.4 to similar to 69.9 mW/m(2).

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The East-Ujimqin complex, located north of the Erenhot-Hegenshan fault, North China, is composed of mafic-ultramafic and granitic rocks including peridotite, gabbro, alkali granite, and syenite. We investigated the tectonic setting, age, and anorogenic characteristics of the Xing'an-MongOlian Orogenic Belt (XMOB) through field investigation and microscopic and geochemical analyses of samples from the East-Ujimqin complex and LA-MC-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating of gabbro and alkali granite. Petrographic and geochemical studies of the complex indicate that this multiphase plutonic suite developed through a combination of fractional crystallization, assimilation processes, and magma mixing. The maficultramafic rocks are alkaline and have within-plate geochemical characteristics, indicating anorogenic magmatism in an extensional setting and derivation from a mantle source. The mafic-ultramafic magmas triggered partial melting of the crust and generated the granitic rocks. The granitic rocks are alkali and metaluminous and have high Fe/(Fe + Mg) characteristics, all of which are common features of withinplate plutons. Zircon U-Pb geochronological dating of two samples of gabbro and alkali granite yielded ages of 280.8 +/- 1.5 and 276.4 +/- 0.7 Ma, placing them within the Early Permian. The zircon Hf isotopic data give inhomogeneous epsilon(Hf)(t) values of 8.2-14.7 for gabbroic zircons and extraordinary high epsilon(Hf)(t) values (8.9-12.5) for the alkali granite in magmatic zircons. Thus, we consider the East-Ujimqin mafic-ultramafic and granitic rocks to have been formed in an extensional tectonic setting caused by asthenospheric upwelling and lithospheric thinning. The sources of mafic-ultramafic and granitic rocks could be depleted garnet lherzolite mantle and juvenile continental lower crust, respectively. All the above indicate that an anorogenic magma event may have occurred in part of the XMOB during 280-276 Ma. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Neoproterozoic igneous rocks are widely distributed in the Kuluketage block along the northern margin of the Tarim Craton. However, the published literature mainly focuses on the ca. 800 Ma adalcitic granitoids in the area, with the granites that intrude the 735-760 Ma mafic-ultramafic rocks poorly studied. Here we report the ages, petrography and geochemistry of two granites in the Xingdi mafic-ultramafic rocks, in order to construct a new view of the non-adakitic younger granites. LA-ICP-MS zircon U-Pb dating provided weighted mean Pb-206/U-238 ages of 743.0 2.5 Ma for the No.I granite (G1) and 739.0 +/- 3.5 Ma for the No.II granite (G2). A clear core-rim texture of similar age and a high zircon saturation temperature of ca. 849 +/- 14 degrees C were observed for the No.I granite; in contrast, G2 has no apparent core-rim texture but rather inherited older zircons and a lower zircon saturation temperature of ca. 763 +/- 17 degrees C. Geochemical analysis revealed that G1 is an alkaline A-type granite and G2 is a high-K calc-alkaline I-type granite. Both granites share similar geochemical characteristics of arc-related magmatic rocks and enriched Sr-Nd-Hf isotopes, likely due to their enriched sources or mixing with enriched magma. Whereas G1 and its host mafic rocks form typical bimodal intrusions of the same age and similar Sr-Nd-Hf isotope compositions, G2 is younger than its host mafic rocks and its Sr-Nd-Hf isotope composition indicates a lower crust origin. Although they exhibit arc-related geochemical features, the two granites likely formed in a rift setting, as inferred from thier petrology, Sr-Nd-Hf isotopes and regional tectonic evolution.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Majuli Island, located in the upper reach of the Brahmaputra valley in Assam (India), has reduced in its areal extent from 787.9 km(2) to 508.2 km2 during the period 1915-2005 (35.5% reduction). This amounts to severe average erosion of 3.1 km(2)/yr. All efforts so far to save the island have failed to achieve the desired redress. The engineering approach of 'Save Majuli' action plans has focused on quarantining the island from the influence of the Brahmaputra River rather than designing long-term process-based solutions anchored on proper understanding of evolution of the relic island. The existing geomorphic model for the evolution of the Majuli Island related its genesis to the great earthquake (M 8.7) in 1750 during which a much smaller palaeo-Brahmaputra developed an anabranch and captured the Burhi Dihing River. The intermediate land-locked area thereby became the Majuli Island that is constituted primarily of the older floodplain deposits. We demonstrate that the evolution of the Majuli Island has been influenced by fluvial morpho-dynamics, as well as basement configuration and tectonic controls. Thus, the landform called the Majuli Island cannot be explained as a simple fluvial geomorphic feature. Rather, it represents an outcome of tectono-geomorphic process having strong subsurface control. We have investigated the influence of geomorphic parameters including channel belt area (CHB), channel belt width (W), braid bar area (BB), channel area (CH), thalweg changes and bankline migration on the trend of erosion of the Majuli Island. Integration of geophysical evidence from seismic data and the surface morphological changes suggest that the Majuli Island and other similar landforms represent structural 'highs'. Morphotectonic evolution of these islands has involved three stages- pre-bypass uplift, Majuli formation and abandonment. The Majuli Island in the Brahmaputra valley is presently passing through the abandonment stage and is gradually being incorporated within the flood plain of the valley. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The present study attempts to understand the importance of place and local factors in the process of valley filling in an active mountain belt. The accumulation of sediments in a valley stretch depends upon the relationship between sediment carried from upstream by the main river entering into the stretch (q(i)), locally derived sediments (i.e., from local streams (q(t)), hillslopes (q(h)), and glacial and periglacial processes (q(g))), and sediment exiting that stretch (q(o)); these are in turn governed by other processes like tectonic activity, intensity of precipitation, and lithology.
   <br>As an example a valley stretch in the NW Himalaya is chosen in the Alaknanda River, one of the two uppermost tributaries of the Ganga River. This stretch is called as Pipalkoti Valley after the name of the main town; it is located close to the Main Central Thrust (MCT) and falls in the zone of orographic precipitation. Detailed geomorphic mapping reveals four surfaces and two terraces. Three debris-flow surfaces suggest their deposition by local mass flows and stream flows with very small contributions from the Alaknanda River. Terrace 72 occurs as a strath in some parts and is made up of fluvial and lacustrine sediments in others. The presence of lacustrine sediments suggests local damming of the river. Thick fluvial sediment is deposited in stretches of the rivers where it becomes wide due to the joining of a tributary. Synsedimentary deformation has been noted indicating that tectonic activity has affected sedimentation.
   <br>The results suggest that local processes played a dominant role in the accumulation of sediments in this valley stretch. A model is proposed showing the role of glacial activity, high intensity meteorological events, river width, active faults and landslide damming in the origin of valley-fill deposits of the Pipalkoti Valley. It is concluded that before correlating valley-fill deposits along the lengths of the Himalayan valleys, it is important to evaluate the role of various local processes that have operated in particular stretches.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Matiali fan is a coarse-grained, small alluvial fan in the eastern Himalayan foothills. It co-exists side by side with the large Tista megafan and other Quaternary fluvial deposits, and has been affected by a number of young thrust faults. It is generally believed that tectonics is the main control in the deposition of these proximal fan-terrace systems. In this paper, geomorphologic and sedimentologic study of the Matiali fan and associated river terraces are combined with five OSL dates from these deposits to understand the succession of events and the forcing mechanism that shaped the geomorphology in the study area during late Quaternary time. Two aggradational terraces (T1 and T2; T2 &gt; T1) occur within the river valleys incised on the Matiali fan. Three E-W scarps cross the fan surface, and they represent the steeper limb of the asymmetric fault-propagation folds formed over blind thrusts. These folds have deformed the fan (T3) and T2 terrace sediments, but the youngest T1 terrace deposits have remained undeformed. Sedimentological studies indicate continuous gradation from the coarsening-upwards mass-flow megagravel in the proximal part to the traction transported finer sheetflood gravels in the distal part, implying a continuous sedimentation history across the fan, uninterrupted by any evidence of syn-depositional tectonic movement Poorly consolidated sandy gravels of the terraces indicate deposition through braided fluvial processes during a later period of sediment aggradation that filled up the incised river valleys. Previously published C-14 dates indicate that deposition of the Matiali fan started around 34 ka coinciding with a period of the intensified Indian summer monsoon of MIS-3. It is suggested that the fan was abandoned and river valleys incised during the LGM between 24 and 18 ka when the discharge decreased substantially. Increased rainfall and sediment supply, with their inherent fluctuations, during wetter periods of MIS-2 and MIS-1 since 12 ka probably resulted in the aggradation of T2 and T1 as shown by our OSL dates. OSL dates from the top of deformed T2 and base of undeformed T1 indicate that the Chalsa fold formed between similar to 11 and similar to 6 ka. Succession of geomorphic and deformational events reconstructed from this study and available age data indicate that the Matiali fan and terrace aggradation coincides with periods of increased monsoonal precipitation, whereas tectonic movements along blind thrusts of Chalsa and Matiali took place later, deforming the fan and older terrace deposits. The evidence unequivocally indicates, contrary to the prevalent notion of tectonic control of geomorphic features in the proximal mountain-front setting, that the deposition of the fan-terrace system was primarily controlled by the fluctuation of the Asian summer monsoon rather than Himalayan tectonics.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The fine-grained sediments of the Cariaco Basin, Venezuela, of the last 130 ky, whose deposition history is well characterized, were analyzed geochemically in order to test the validity of sediment bulk geochemistry as an indicator of detrital provenance. Several binary and ternary diagrams as well as the chemical index of alteration (CIA) were tested for their capacity to discriminate the poorly contrasted detrital sources to the Cariaco Basin, and to describe the temporal evolution of the contributions of these different sources. Most of the diagrams tested did not allow a good discrimination of sources or, when sources were well discriminated, did not allow an interpretation of the temporal variations consistent with the known history. A relatively good discrimination of sources and a consistent interpretation of temporal variations were however obtained using Hf vs. Th and La/Yb vs. Gd/Yb binary diagrams, as well as Ti-Zr-Th, Ti-Zr-La, and Lu-Hf-Th ternary diagrams. Compared to the previous studies of the detrital content of the Cariaco Basin sediments, the geochemical approach permitted the recognition of a sediment contribution eroded from the Unare platform and Gulf of Cariaco during rapid sea level oscillations, and the contribution of Saharan eolian particles during the Younger Dryas-Preboreal and MIS6-5 transition. The choice of plotted elements was determined after considering carrier minerals, so that different elements may be informative in different sedimentary contexts. Overall, mineral sorting during transport appears as a major limit to quantitative estimation of the different contributions. In particular mineral sorting leads to the selective enrichment of elements associated with clays (Al, Rb, Th and LREE) in sediments deposited in the basin. Unless the geochemical effect of mineral sorting can be measured, it appears that quantitative provenance analysis should be performed on fractions of similar grain size instead of bulk sediment.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This work analyzes through field, geophysical, geochemical and geochronological data, a particular setting of the Southern Andes in which an extensional system is flanking the mountain front. This setting is represented by the Loncopue Trough, whose origin is discussed for this part of the Andes. This work reconstructs 3-dimensionally the structure of this basin and its evolution through time, since Jurassic times as a series of isolated depocenters, to Late Cretaceous-Eocene times with the construction of a positive relief that subsequently was relaxed through two extensional stages during the late Oligocene-early Miocene and the Pliocene-Quaternary respectively. The last episode of extension is characterized by an initial stage with a series of caldera-collapses in the latest Pliocene-early Quaternary. This passed to a stage of development of a broad basaltic plateau in pre- and interglacial times, circumscribed with new radiometric data to the Pleistocene. Quaternary products in northern and central Loncopue Trough have chemical relations that are intermediate between the arc front and the southern Loncopue Trough volcanic rocks studied in previous works. Thus, retroarc eruptions would be part of an extended arc configuration that goes from typical arc series in the northern part of the trough to within-plate series in the south. Low elastic thicknesses computed from gravity data in this work correlate with the area of retroarc volcanic activity. Magnetic data have allowed determining the Curie isotherm, showing two areas of relatively abnormal heat flow, one along the Loncopue Trough itself and the other in the foreland zone. This scenario is discussed through three main hypotheses: an occurrence linked to a slab-steepening after a shallow subduction in the area; co-seismic crustal stretching linked to giant earthquakes in the subduction zone; and, finally slab-tearing associated with asthenospheric upwelling.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Understanding the relationships between density and spatio-thermal variations at convergent plate boundaries is important for deciphering the present-day dynamics and evolution of subduction zones. In particular, the interaction between densification due to mineralogical phase transitions and slab pull forces is subject to ongoing investigations. We have developed a two-dimensional subduction zone model that is based on thermodynamic equilibrium assemblage calculations and includes the effects of melting processes on the density distribution in the lithosphere. Our model calculates the "metamorphic density" of rocks as a function of pressure, temperature and chemical composition in a subduction zone down to 250 km. We have used this model to show how the hydration, dehydration, partial melting and fractionation processes of rocks all influence the metamorphic density and greatly depend on the temperature field within the subduction system. These processes are largely neglected by other approaches that reproduce the density distribution within this complex tectonic setting. Our model demonstrates that the initiation of edogitization (i.e., when crustal rocks reach higher densities than the ambient mantle) of the slab is not the only significant process that makes the descending slab denser and generates the slab pull force. Instead, the densification of the lithospheric mantle of the sinking slab starts earlier than eclogitization and contributes significantly to slab pull in the early stages of subduction. Accordingly, the complex metamorphic structure of the slab and the mantle wedge has an important impact on the development of subduction zones. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The southeastern Tibetan Plateau (SE Tibet), located between the Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis and Sichuan Basin, is a heterogeneous structure combining different tectonic regimes. It encompasses a gently sloping long-wavelength margin, and is characterized by intense deformation and active seismicity. Mechanical strength of the lithosphere is one of the parameters that controls deformation and evolution of any region. In particular, anisotropy of the strength is important for understanding the relation between tectonic processes and lithosphere deformation. As a proxy, the effective elastic thickness of the lithosphere (T-e) can be used to study both spatial distribution and anisotropy of the lithospheric strength. Here we use the fan wavelet coherence method to determine variations of T-e and its anisotropy based on the topography and Bouguer gravity anomaly data. The coherence analysis shows that low T-e (5-30 km) and high T-e anisotropy are widespread in SE Tibet, indicating a weak and highly mechanical anisotropic lithosphere. This also implies that the style of lithospheric deformation is continuous, and may be dominated by lower crustal flow. Compared with the crustal stress and lithospheric strain indicators, we find that the T-e anisotropy is predominantly governed by the present-day tectonic stress in SE Tibet. This may indicate a post-collision compression tectonics within the plateau due to the India-Eurasia plate convergence and a resistance by the rigid Sichuan Basin. However, the anisotropy reflects extension stresses in approximately WNW-ESE direction in Yunnan and northern Indochina off the plateau, which may relate to the Burma plate subduction processes. We infer that the present-day tectonic stresses and mantle processes associated with the India-Eurasia collision continuously modify and rework the mechanical structure, and both govern the lithospheric deformation in SE Tibet.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The cause of tectonic deformation in northwestern South America and its link to upper mantle structure and flow are debated. We use a combination of broadband and short period travel time seismic data for P-waves to show that observations are consistent with the presence of two subduction segments in Colombia and contrasting values of crustal thickness. In Northern Colombia, at latitudes greater than 6 degrees N, most of the seismic stations are associated with negative teleseismic travel time residuals, relative to a regional mean, suggesting that the upper mantle is seismically faster than predicted from global models. In particular, for the Caribbean coastal plains there are no signs of significant anomalies in the upper mantle, evidenced by the small magnitude of the travel time delays and subdued Pn speeds (similar to 7.97 km/s). To the southeast of such plains there is an increase in magnitude of the negative travel time residuals, including the Northern Eastern Cordillera, the Perija Range and the Merida Andes. An analysis of non-isostatic residual topography, based on a model of crustal thickness in northwestern South America, is consistent with a slab-associated upper mantle flow beneath the region just east of the Bucaramanga Nest. We interpret these results to indicate the presence of a Caribbean slab, initially flat beneath the Caribbean coastal plains, and steepening sharply in the southeast, including the area of Bucaramanga. For most of the western Andean region and the Pacific coast, south of 6 degrees N, teleseismic differential travel time residuals are predominantly positive, indicating that the upper mantle is in general seismically slower than the reference model. Beneath the Central Cordillera, just to the east of this area, the residuals become smaller and predominantly negative; residual non-isostatic topography is negative as well. These features are probably related to the effect of the Nazca subduction developing an asthenospheric wedge. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In Central Zambia, the Mwembeshi Zone (MwZ) separates two branches of the Pan-African Orogen: the Lufilian Arc and the Zambezi Belt. To the north of the MwZ, the Hook Batholith was emplaced within Neoproterozoic Katangan metasedimentary rocks. Field mapping and structural studies, microstructural observations, interpretation of airborne geophysical images and U-Pb zircon geochronology constrain a new model for the tectonic evolution of this poorly studied part of the orogen.
   <br>Two temporarily separated and highly oblique orogenic contraction events are defined. D1 is characterised by a regional low-metamorphic grade E-W shortening that produced strain partitioning between N-S trending pure-shear-dominated and NW trending sinistral simple-shear dominated domains. The emplacement of the batholith between ca. 550 and 533 Ma (U-Pb zircon ages) is syn-tectonic to D1. The D2 N-S shortening event was active after ca. 530, which is indicated by the age of the newly dated, deformed molasse of the Hook Batholith. During D2, the MwZ developed as an E- to ENE-striking zone of pure-shear dominated deformation that localised to the south and within the already exhumed Hook Batholith.
   <br>At the scale of the Pan-African Orogen in Southern Africa, the D1 is considered to be a far field expression of the E-W collision event in the Mozambique Belt. The following Early Cambrian D2 event corresponds to the high angle collision between the Congo and Kalahari Cratons and the stitching of the Lufilian and Zambezi belts along the MwZ. Therefore, in the Hook area, the MwZ cannot be regarded as a continental-scale wrench structure as widely discussed in the literature. The tectonic events in Central Zambia suggest that the amalgamation of Gondwana was accompanied by suturing along highly oblique orogenic belts during plate reorganization at around 530 Ma.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Taking advantage of the dense continuous GPS network data, we demonstrate the effective utility of the method of empirical orthogonal function (EOF) in obtaining the coseismic deformation (vector) field on the crustal surface caused by significant earthquakes. We conduct case studies w.r.t. two earthquakes that have occurred in Taiwan: one off the east coast of Taiwan in 2002 (Event I, Mw 7.1) and one inland in southern Taiwan in 2010 (Event II, Mw 5.7 or 6.3). We demonstrate that, superior to the simple least-squares estimates obtained directly from individual GPS position time series, the EOF analysis is capable of extracting the coseismic deformation in the form of coherent spatial pattern and time evolution. The prevalent common-mode errors in the GPS data are also well resolved as distinctive and separate EOF modes. The extracted coseismic spatial patterns provide evidences linking the regional tectonics with the orogenic process in Taiwan under the plate convergence. We further contrast our EOF results against those calculated via idealized elastic dislocation models, and find notable discrepancies especially for the far field, which can be attributed to the complexity of the tectonic environment of Taiwan.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Regional observations suggest that the Central Anatolian plateau (central Turkey) has risen by &gt;1 km since the Tortonian (similar to 8 Ma) while significant crustal shortening did not occur. This uplift was preceded by the onset of widespread volcanism (similar to 14-9 Ma). The lithospheric context of these events is however unknown. For the Eastern Anatolian plateau, similar events have been attributed to the late-stage evolution of the northern Neotethys slab, resulting in delamination and slab breakofE Recent tomographic results indicate that this slab extended beneath both below the Eastern and Central Anatolian plateau just prior to delamination. We propose a new lithospheric scenario for the regional evolution in the Aegean-Anatolian-Near East region that combines a recent compilation of surface geology data with the structure of the upper mantle. Following the Cretaceous-Eocene closure of the northern Neotethys, Africa-Eurasia convergence was accommodated by horizontal subduction at a trench that was located south of Anatolia. Like before the closure, the northern Neotethys slab continued to sink into the deeper mantle beneath the Izmir-Ankara-Erzincan suture. In the early Miocene (similar to 20-15 Ma), the northern Neotethys slab started to retreat southward to the trench, resulting in delamination of the lithospheric mantle. The last part of this scenario is testable, whether delamination can explain the uplift of both the Central and Eastern Anatolian plateau. In the east, uplift due to collision of Arabia is included. We use a coupled thermal-flexural model of the lithosphere. The model results show that delamination can explain the average present-day long-wavelength topography of the Central Anatolian plateau. For the Eastern Anatolian plateau, delamination explains half the present-day elevation. We find that a single delamination event also accounts for the present-day surface heat flow and Curie-point depth in both plateaus. We therefore propose to refer to central and east Anatolia since the middle Miocene as "the Anatolian plateau". (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Unraveling the tectonic style in the outer zones of fold-and-thrust belts is generally puzzling because the basement-cover relationships are often hidden in the subsurface as in the outer Northern Apennines of Italy. This study aims to reconstruct the deep setting of the Northern Apennine foreland thrust belt by integrating surface structural-geological and subsurface seismic reflection profile and well data, corroborated by a gravity-magnetic modeling. A remarkable mountain ridge, the Umbria-Marche Apennine Ridge (UMAR), which corresponds to a prominent area of structural and topographic elevation, characterizes the morphology of the Northern Apennines. This mountain ridge is constituted by Meso-Cenozoic carbonates involved in Neogene compressive structures and is surrounded by wide exposures of foredeep deposits. The basement-cover relationships are poorly constrained and both thin- and thick-skinned tectonic styles have been applied. The interpretation of subsurface data allowed recognizing a thick pre-Jurassic sedimentary sequence filling a late Paleozoic(?)-Triassic symmetric fault-bounded extensional basin, lying directly below the UMAR. This deep-rooted basin underwent positive inversion during the Neogene compression and thrust-fold development. The reconstructed thick-skinned inversion tectonic model is consistent with both the modest amount of shortening and the remarkable structural elevation of the UMAR.
   <br>The outcomes of this study reveal that prominent mountain ridges occurring in foreland thrust belts are most likely related to the deep-rooted basement-involved positive inversion of pre-existing extensional basins. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Irregular basement geometry may affect thrust propagation in foreland fold-thrust belts creating a perturbation in structural continuity of hydrocarbon fields. Here we investigate how the irregular pattern of normal faults, along with the presence of uplifts and transverse faults in the Grenvillian basement has influenced the geometry and emplacement of frontal thrusts and duplexes in the parautochthonous domain of the southern Quebec Appalachians during the middle-late Ordovician Taconian orogeny. Integration of data from surface geology, wells, and 2D and 3D seismic reflection surveys into a regional-scale structural model is used to reconstruct the 3D geometry and emplacement history of one- and two-horse duplexes in the Joly-Saint-Flavien gas storage area. The normal hinterland to foreland sequence of thrusting in this area is complicated by the differential emplacement of tectonic slices along strike of the orogenic front, starting in the SW and developing subsequently to the NE within each structural level. The shortening related to duplex emplacement decreases laterally over the distance of 20 km from -49% in the SW (Joly area) to -31% in the NE (Saint-Flavien area). Duplex emplacement resulted from the differential forward propagation, deflexion and vertical-axis rotation of the roof thrust (Logan's Line), which, in turn, has been induced by the presence of frontal uplift and transverse faults in the basement. The structural-lithological analysis of tectonic slices and restoration of their initial location allows us to consider the lower slice of the Joly duplex as a structural trap comparable to the fractured reservoir in lower Ordovician dolomites of the Saint-Flavien duplex.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>We used paleomagnetic and structural data to investigate the late Eocene-Oligocene tectonic evolution of the Mesa Central area in Mexico. The Mesa Central was affected by NW-trending faults (Tepehuanes-San Luis fault system) coeval with a Late Eocene-Oligocene ignimbrite flare-up and by post-27 Ma NNE-trending grabens related to the Basin and Range. We obtained reliable paleomagnetic directions from 61 sites within the Late Eocene-Oligocene volcanic series (similar to 30 to similar to 27 Ma) of the San Luis Potosi volcanic field and Sierra de Guanajuato. For each site we also measured the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS). Tilt corrections were made using AMS data for 33 sites where in situ bedding measurements were not available. Paleomagnetic directions indicate counterclockwise rotations of about 10 with respect to stable North America after 30-25 Ma. Structural data suggest that the volcanic succession was mainly affected by normal faults. However, we also found evidences for oblique or horizontal striae showing a left-lateral component along NW-trending faults and a right lateral component along NE-trending faults. Both motions are consistent with a N-S extension oblique to the Tepehuanes-San Luis fault system. Previous paleomagnetic studies in northern and southern Mexico show the prevalence of minor left-lateral shear components along regional-scale transpressional and transtensional lineaments. Our paleomagnetic data may reflect thus small vertical-axis rotations related to a minor shear component coeval with the Oligocene intra-arc extension in central Mexico. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This study focuses on the analysis of structures and kinematics of a N-S profile along the axis of maximum shortening of the European Eastern Alps. The area includes the southern Austroalpine unit in the north and the Southalpine unit, which is a part of the Adriatic indenter. The stratigraphically different units are separated by the Periadriatic fault, the major strike-slip fault within the Alps. In order to assess the kinematics of these units, mainly fault-slip data from north and south of the Periadriatic fault were analyzed. We distinguish a succession of five main kinematic groups in both units: (1) N-S compression; (2) NW-SE compression; (3) NE-SW compression, sigma(3) changes gradually from subvertical to subhorizontal; (4) N-S compression; and (5) NW-SE compression. Our study reveals that the deformation sequence on either sides of the PAF is similar. The mean orientations of the principal stress axes, however, show small, but consistent differences: The subhorizontal axes north of the Periadriatic fault plunge northward, in the south southward. A counterclockwise (CCW) rotation of the southern part in respect to the north is evident and in line with the well-known counterclockwise rotation of the Adriatic indenter as well as dextral displacement of the N-fanning stress-field along the Periadriatic fault Opposing plunge directions are interpreted as a primary feature of the internal stress-field within an orogenic wedge further increased during ongoing compression.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Magma flow directions for 6 Late Cretaceous mafic dyke swarms exposed in coastal southeastern China (SE China) were analyzed using anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) and field evidence. Normal AMS fabrics are predominant. The AMS of the dyke swarms originates mainly from the distribution anisotropy of intersertal magnetite that crystallized during late stage magma flow or after the magma cooled. The AMS fabrics record tectonic stress combined with magma flow. Sub-vertical to vertical magma flow is inferred from symmetrical imbricated magnetic foliations of dyke walls and field evidence for 5 dyke swarms. The inferred (sub-) vertical flow directions also indicate that the magma chambers were probably just beneath the sampled locations. Low anisotropy degree, different orientations of principal AMS axes, and asymmetrical magnetic foliations of normal fabrics oblique to dyke walls indicate syntectonic emplacement of the late Cretaceous dyke swarms under an extensional tectonic regime caused by Paleo-Pacific plate subduction.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Major element, trace element, and Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic compositions of Cenozoic diabase in southeastern China provide insights into the nature of their mantle sources and processes. The diabases are alkaline in lithochemistry (Na2O+K2O=4.37-5.19wt.%) and have overall oceanic island basalt-like trace element patterns, without negative Nb-Ta anomalies. In addition, they are characterized by lower La/Nb (&lt;1.5) and La/Ta (&lt;22), and higher Ce/Pb (&gt;15) and Nb/U (&gt;30) ratios, indicating an origin in the asthenospheric mantle. The relatively lower Nd-143/Nd-144 (0.512632-0.512648) and Pb-206/Pb-204 (18.20-18.22), but intermediate Sr-87/Sr-86 (0.7061-0.7063) ratios of the diabases are similar to enriched mantle type 1, suggesting crustal contamination or mixing with metasomatized lithsopheric mantle. However, the low Th and U contents and lack of correlations of Nd isotope compositions and MgO preclude significant crustal contamination. Alternatively, the moderate TiO2 contents (2.01-2.09wt.%) and high Cr concentrations (&gt;240ppm) suggest interaction between asthenosphere-derived melts and metasomatized lithospheric mantle. Petrological modelling suggests that the diabases were generated from a low degree (~3-5%) of partial melting of lherzolite with ~2-3% garnet. Jiangxi diabase was generated in a within-plate extensional regime, probably related to the far effect of the Himalaya-Tibetan orogen.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The South Yellow Sea basin in eastern China has experienced a multi-stage tectonic evolution history. The major structures were created when the basin was a foreland basin during the Mesozoic. However the geological evolution of the basin has not yet been corroborated by direct evidence from the underlying basement rocks. Qianliyan Island in the southern Yellow Sea provides an opportunity to study the formation and evolution of the basin by means of direct geochronological and geochemical evidence. On Qianliyan Island, basement rocks are exposed that consist of granitic gneiss, felsic gneiss and minor mylonite, and lenses of eclogite. Major and trace element characteristics of these four types of gneiss indicate that they originated from crustal material, varying in composition from pelite to greywacke. SHRIMP U-Pb zircon dating results of a felsic gneiss sample show that this rock crystallized between 659 and 796Ma and underwent a metamorphic overprint at 229 +/- 4Ma. This age pattern resembles that of gneisses from the ultra-high-pressure terrain in the Dabie-Sulu belt. We conclude that the study area was part of the northern margin of the Yangtze Block during the Neoproterozoic. Neoproterozoic magmatic activity occurred along this margin and the basement sequence underwent Triassic metamorphic overprint during the northward subduction of the Yangtze Block beneath the North China Block. We further conclude that the deformation associated with this metamorphic event led to the formation of the southern Yellow Sea foreland basin.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Basement exposed in the Placer de Guadalupe-Plomosas uplift in northern Mexico provides important clues for the geologic evolution of the region. The stratigraphic units form stacked thrust sheets of psammitic and calcareous formations, interlayered with magmatic rock. The eastern calcareous and quartzite formations exhibit structures associated with ductile deformation, whereas the upper stratigraphic units only contain structures formed via younger brittle deformation. Porphyry interlayered in the upper Plomosas Formation has a U-Pb zircon age of 171 +/- 1Ma. This age is consistent with its stratigraphic position, interbedded quartzarenites with a maximum depositional age of ~168Ma. Granite flakes within the Horquilla Formation are dated at 209 +/- 3Ma, and the La Vinata quartzite exhibits a maximum age of ~193Ma. The Upper Plomosas Formation correlates well with the arc-related Middle Jurassic Nazas Formation of northeastern Mexico, constituting the first report of a Jurassic continental margin arc outcrop in the 'Central Mexican Gap zone'. We document Late Norian to Bajocian ages for the stratigraphic units cropping out in the Placer de Guadalupe area. The Jurassic age cluster indicates that the Nazas Arc magmatism in the region occurred during the Late Triassic and ended in the Middle Jurassic times. Permian ages previously assigned to these rocks and the occurrence of a Permo-Triassic deformation event have to be dismissed.</td>

In spite of the available information on fault segments and tectonic activity associated with faulting, the local scale fault characteristics are currently barely known and are often difficult to detect in areas where surface displacement has not occurred. The present geological field investigation reveals that the study area in Surat Thani province possibly contains more minor faults where the shallow faulting is evident. To detect fault locations and to study fault characteristics, seismic reflection analysis and 2-D electrical imaging were applied along the three survey lines as a case study. After data processing, an interpretation was proposed based on the correlation of geophysical results with the geological information. Discontinuities in the main horizons in seismic sections and correlatable zones in resistivity imaging indicate that faulting is present in a Permian-Carboniferous unit and may extend to the shallow subsurface in Quaternary sediments.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Hydrothermal mineralization hosted by the Lower Cretaceous igneous rock of the teschenite association at Jasenice (Silesian Unit, Flysch Belt, Outer Western Carpathians) occurs in two morphological types - irregular vein filled by granular calcite and regular composite vein formed by both fibrous and granular calcite and minor chlorite, quartz, and pyrite. Crosscutting evidence indicates that the granular veins are younger than the composite vein. The composite vein was formed by two mechanisms at different times. The arrangement of solid inclusions in the marginal fibrous zone suggests an episodic growth by the crack-seal mechanism during syntectonic deformation which was at least partially driven by tectonic suction pump during some stages of the Alpine Orogeny. Both the central part of the composite vein and monomineral veins developed in a brittle regime. In these cases, the textures of vein suggest the flow of fluids along an open fracture. The parent fluids of both types of vein are characterized by low temperatures (Th = 66-163 degrees C), low salinities (0.4 to 3.4 wt. % NaCl eq.), low content of strong REE-complexing ligands, and delta O-18 and delta C-13 ranges of +0.2/+12.5 parts per thousand SMOW and -11.8/-14.1 parts per thousand PDB, respectively. The parent fluids are interpreted as the results of mixing of residual seawater and diagenetic waters produced by dewatering of clay minerals in the associated flysch sediments. The flow of fluids was controlled by tectonic deformation of the host rock.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The discussions on the orogenic evolution during Earth's history converge to the question of a different thermal structure in the Archean compared to the Phanerozoic and the applicability of the plate tectonic paradigm. However, geothermal structures are transient in orogens and are difficult to translate into large-scale tectonics and exhumation rates. Therefore, we propose depth-time data in the Archean Skjoldungen Orogen (SE Greenland, North Atlantic Craton) that allow for reconstruction of an exhumation rate independent of geothermal gradients. The resulting exhumation rate of ca. 0.4 km/Ma is similar to exhumation rates during erosion-controlled processes in modern orogens. These exhumation rates can only be established by erosion time constants similar to modern orogens. The occurrence of erosion-controlled exhumation is best explained by a stiff foreland promoting localized deformation in the orogen. Therefore, a switch from magmatic-dominated processes to localized deformation is proposed in the Skjoldungen Orogen area. This is supported by a change in magma composition and volume, from widespread granodiorite to localized alkaline intrusions. In addition, the involved metasedimentary rocks include detrital zircons of the only 50 Ma older foreland, which also correspond to erosion and tectonics as in modern orogens, i.e. flysh-type sediments. Relatively fast exhumation rates and the structural-magmatic evolution of the Neoarchean Skjoldungen Orogen thus indicate modern-style tectonic processes where stiff Mesoarchean continental crust forms a foreland to a collisional orogen instead of typical accretionary tectonics of weak island arc-like terranes in granite-greenstone terranes.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Palaeoproterozoic Nagssugtoqidian Orogen extends over 250 km along the east coast of Greenland around the settlement of Tasiilaq. The orogen includes Archaean rocks from the adjoining Rae Craton to the north and the North Atlantic Craton to the south, and Palaeoproterozoic rocks. The Rae Craton consists of orthogneiss and amphibolite included in the Schweizerland and Kuummiut Terranes, and is tectonically overlain in the Kuummiut Terrane by ca. 2100-2200 Ma units that include marble, metapelite and -psammite and amphibolite assigned to the Helheim and Kuummiut units. The Kuummiut Terrane was probably subducted underneath the SE-trending ca. 1885 Ma Ammassalik Intrusive Complex, which has a high-temperature metamorphic halo and is characterised by a change from sinistral faulting to pure shear deformation. The southern Isortoq Terrane consists of medium-pressure amphibolite facies bimodal meta-volcanic and &lt;1910 Ma meta-sedimentary rocks assigned to the Kap Tycho Brahe unit, which is in tectonic contact with orthogneiss and amphibolite of the North Atlantic Craton.
   <br>The rocks of the Kuummiut Terrane were tectonically imbricated in ENE-verging structures during ca. 1870 Ma high-pressure metamorphism. This was followed by NE-SW convergence and close to orthogonal extrusion in the weakened crust, which is characterised by partial melting during decompression. The rocks of the Isortoq Terrane were imbricated in a SE-vergent thrust and ramp system either during oblique subduction of the Kuummiut Terrane or an earlier tectonic stage elsewhere. NE-SW compression, as in the northern terranes, formed SW-vergent thrust systems and folds. This was most likely caused by a change in the regional stress field during collision between ca. 1870 and 1820 Ma. In the north, the Schweizerland Terrane was juxtaposed to the Kuummiut Terrane in southeasterly direction, causing refolding of earlier structures in the lower amphibolite facies. This hinteland-type of deformation was possibly related to tectonism in western Greenland. The latest recognised deformation event was during ca. 1740-1680 Ma associated with NE-SW extension, which is interpreted as orogenic collapse. The complex structural evolution of the orogen was caused by oblique convergence during WSW-directed subduction, the convergence of irregularly shaped cratons and the change of the regional stress field from ENE-WSW to NW-SE during progressive collisional tectonics between the two Archaean cratons.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>We report zircon ages, Hf-in-zircon isotopes as well as whole-rock geochemistry and Hf-Nd isotopic systematics for Palaeoarchaean grey gneisses of the Ancient Gneiss Complex of Swaziland, the oldest components of the Kaapvaal craton, southern Africa. The Hf-in-zircon isotopic compositions in these compositionally heterogeneous, multicomponent, migmatitic gneisses are highly variable, even in the oldest zircons dating back to 3.66 Ga, suggesting growth of zircon from melts representing a mix of juvenile and anatectic material derived from differentiated continental crust of Eoarchean to late Hadean age. In contrast, the initial Nd and Hf whole-rock isotopic compositions are frequently not in agreement with the Hf-in-zircon data that mostly show approximately chondritic initial values for Nd and strongly radiogenic initial values for Hf. We consider it likely that both the Lu-Hf and Sm-Nd whole-rock isotopic systems were disturbed and partly reset during later episodes of partial melting and crustal reworking, most likely during a pervasive 3.2 Ga tectono-metamorphic event.
   <br>Primitive mantle-normalized trace element patterns show the variable influence of residual plagioclase and garnet in the sources as well as high contents of strongly incompatible elements. In conjunction with the Hf-in-zircon isotopic data the trace element contents are best explained by the incorporation of older continental crustal material into the sources of the grey gneisses. Our data support evidence from other Palaeoarchean terranes that crustal recycling, as seen in even the oldest crustal components, played an important role in early continental evolution. Rocks previously classified as a subduction-related tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite suite are complex, and their chemistry alone cannot be used to reconstruct tectonic settings.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Western Shandong Province is a typical area of the North China Craton (NCC) where Neoarchean plutonic and supracrustal rocks are widely distributed. Early studies documented that similar to 2.7 Ga and similar to 2.5 Ga magmato-tectono-thermal events are well developed in the area. Here we report SHRIMP U-Pb ages and Hf-in-zircon isotopic data from ten samples of different magmatic rock types including hornblendite, gneissic tonalite, gneissic trondhjemite and gneissic granite. Magmatic zircon grains have (207)pb/(206)pb ages ranging from 2667 to 2598 Ma. Some rocks contain similar to 2.5 Ga metamorphic rims and similar to 2.7 Ga zircon cores. The magmatic zircon grains have epsilon(Hf)(t) values and Hf crustal model ages of -1.1 to +11.3 and 3.02-2.4 Ga, respectively. Combined with an earlier study, our main conclusions are that the middle Neoarchean rocks mainly occur together with early Neoarchean rocks in the northeastern portion of the central belt. Juvenile additions to continental crust and crustal recycling played important roles in the middle Neoarchean of western Shandong Province, and the entire Neoarchean tectonic evolution can be divided into middle to early Neoarchean (2.75-2.6 Ga) and late Neoarchean (2.6-2.5 Ga) events.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Jiaodong Terrane is situated in the northeastern part of the Shandong Province in eastern China, experiencing multi-stage magmatism during the Mesoarchean (similar to 2.9 Ga) and Neoarchean (similar to 2.7 Ga and similar to 2.5 Ga). It consists dominantly of granitoid gneisses with minor amphibolite enclaves or lenses. This study presents new whole-rock geochemical and Sm-Nd isotopic data for the Archean granitoid gneisses from the Jiaodong Terrane in order to constrain their petrogenesis and tectonic setting. Geochemical studies and petrological features suggest that the protoliths of most granitoid gneisses are typical Archean tonalitic-trondhjemitic-granodioritic (TTG) suites, which are high in SiO2 (60.9-76.8 wt%), Al2O3 (12.6-16.8 wt.%), Na2O (3.3-5.3 wt.%), Sr (135-604 ppm) and Sr/Y ratios (13.9-84), but low in MgO (0.4-4.5 wt.%), K2O (0.7-3.4 wt.%), TiO2 (0.2-0.9 wt.%), Cr (&lt;0.5-37.9 ppm), Ni (&lt;0.5-24 ppm), Y (2.8-19 ppm) and Mg number (Mg-# =30-45). They are generally enriched in light rare earth elements (LREE) and large ion lithophile elements (LILE), depleted in heavy rare earth elements (HREE) and high field strength elements (HFSE), with slight Eu anomalies. These geochemical features suggest that they were derived from partial melting of metabasaltic rocks leaving eclogite or garnet-amphibolite dominant in the residue. Whole-rock Nd isotopes reveal that the protoliths of Mesoarchean (similar to 2.9 Ga) granitoid gneisses were derived mainly from juvenile sources, whereas the early Neoarchean (similar to 2.7 Ga) granitoid gneisses were derived from juvenile sources with significant additions of crustal material and the late Neoarchean (similar to 2.5 Ga) granitoid gneisses were mainly derived from continental crustal sources. Combined with other geological considerations, a mantle plume model is favored to account for the generation of both early and late Neoarchean granitoid gneisses, whereas the tectonic setting for the Mesoarchean granitoid gneisses remains uncertain due to lack of geological data.

It consists of a similar to 126 kr shield volcano crowned by a cinder cone, separated by a paleosol dated at 28,360 +/- 170 BP. The shield volcano has been cut by the E-W normal Patzcuaro fault that exposes 200-m of piled up lavas flows. Our field reconstruction suggests that two collapses have been originated from this fault. Two debris avalanche deposits with hummocky topography are exposed between this fault and the southern shore of the Patzcuaro Lake. The basal debris avalanche deposit (BDAD) covers lacustrine sediments and is covered by a paleosol that at 28,110 +/- 720 yr BP yielding a minimum age for the event. It had a maximum run out of 3.2 km with a H/L of 0.0062. The upper debris avalanche deposit (UDAD) is overlain by a paleosol dated at 14,110 60 yr BP that yields a minimum age of the event. It had a maximum run out of 23 km with a H/L of 0.0086. No pyroclastic deposits have been found in association with these debris avalanches and the shield volcano rocks show signs of intense hydrothermal alteration or abundant clay minerals for which we assume that failure was triggered by seismic-tectonic activity.
   <br>The older debris avalanche was more mobile because it moved on water and on top of water-saturated sediments deforming them and likely originating a tsunami across the lake. Instead, the younger debris avalanche moved across the previous rugged hummocky topography of the basal avalanche resulting in a more restricted dispersion.
   <br>These collapse events of El Estribo, the morphology of the scarp and historic and modern seismicity indicate that a future failure represents a serious threat to the surrounding communities of the Patzcuaro Lake. Consequently, some preventive measurements as seismic and deformation rate monitoring are necessary. Today five villages with circa 1500 inhabitants live upon the mass waste deposits.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Barren Island in the Andaman Sea is an active mafic stratovolcano, which had explosive and effusive eruptions, followed by caldera formation, in prehistoric time (poorly dated). A scoria cone within the caldera, marking volcanic resurgence, was active periodically from 1787 to 1832 (the historic eruptions). Since 1991, the same scoria cone has produced six eruptions, commonly including lava flows. Links between Barren Island's eruptions and giant earthquakes (such as the 26 December 2004 Great Sumatra megathrust earthquake) have been suggested, though there is no general correlation between them. The &gt;= 227-year-long activity of the scoria cone, named here Shanku ("cone"), is normally driven by purely magmatic processes. I present a "source to surface" model for Barren Island and Shanku, including the source region, deeper and shallow magma chambers, volcanotectonics, dyking from magma chambers, and eruptions and eruptive style as controlled by crustal stresses, composition and volatile content. Calculations show that dykes similar to 0.5 m thick and a few hundred meters long, originating from shallow-level magma chambers (similar to 5 km deep), are suitable feeders of the Shanku eruptions. Shanku, a polygenetic scoria cone (at least 13 eruptions since 1787), has three excellent analogues, namely Anak Krakatau (40 eruptions since 1927), Cerro Negro (23 eruptions since 1850), and Yasur (persistent activity for the past hundreds of years). This is an important category of volcanoes, gradational between small "monogenetic" scoria cones and larger "polygenetic" volcanoes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Lacustrine sediments from Paleogene foreland basins of the North American Cordillera serve as powerful integrators of information on climatic and tectonic conditions, but episodes of hydrologic connection between basins may confound straightforward interpretations. We use stable isotope ratios of carbon and oxygen in authigenic carbonates of the Flagstaff Formation in central Utah to investigate the history of the lake system which produced these sediments. Flagstaff limestone and dolostone exhibit isotopic compositions consistent with having formed from the same fluid at surface conditions, indicating high evaporative concentration was unnecessary to drive dolomite precipitation. Isotopic data are consistent with the Flagstaff Formation having been produced by a large lake which occupied its basin from the late Paleocene into the early Eocene. Lake Flagstaff was hydrologically distinct from Lake Uinta to the north, but may have been connected to Lake Claron in the south. Paleoaltimetry estimates suggest that the mean elevation of Lake FlagstafPs catchment in the Sevier Highlands did not exceed 1.5 km. The growing evidence from stable isotope data that Cordilleran elevations were relatively low in the early Paleogene is in stark contrast to structural and sedimentological evidence for a high Nevadaplano and a topographically rugged Sevier thrust belt.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Scaled 3D sandbox models have been used to investigate the 3D geometry and evolution of transtensional pull-apart basins. In this paper two representative analogue models were constructed to simulate the evolution of a 5 degrees transtensional pull-apart basin formed above an underlapping, 45 degrees strike-slip releasing bend basement stepover. Model 1 had 1: 1 relative motion between opposing plates whereas Model 2 had 2: 1 relative plate motion. In both experiments, a rhomboidal pull-apart basin developed with one central depocentre that was bounded by en-echelon basin margin faults. The early stages of basin evolution were characterised by basin subsidence and the nucleation of en-echelon normal faults. In the latter stages strike-slip occurred along the en-echelon normal faults, a cross-basin strike-slip fault formed and incremental basin subsidence decreased. Model 1 developed a symmetric basin whereas Model 2 developed a weakly asymmetric basin that had very active basin margin faults above the faster moving plate and a segmented cross-basin strike-slip fault system. The models were compared to the Cinarcik basin, Sea of Marmara. Both the analogue models and the natural prototype were characterised by basin margins bounded on one side by a simple, steeply-dipping normal fault and on the other side by an en-echelon array of steeply-dipping normal faults. The Model 1 showed similarities to the central and eastern part of the Cinarcik basin.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The different geodynamic models proposed since the late 1990s to account for the complex evolution of the Gibraltar Arc System lack definite constraints on the crustal structure of the Rif orogen. Here we present the first well-resolved P-wave velocity crustal models of the Rif Cordillera and its southern continuation toward the Atlas made using controlled-source seismic data. Two 300+ km-long wide-angle reflection profiles crossed the Rif along NS and EW trends. The profiles recorded simultaneously five land explosions of 1Tn each using approximate to 850 high frequency seismometers. The crustal structure revealed from 2-D forward modeling delineates a complex, laterally varying crustal structure below the Rif domains. The most surprising feature, seen on both profiles, is a approximate to 50 km deep crustal root localized beneath the External Rif. To the east, the crust thins rapidly by 20 km across the Nekkor fault, indicating that the fault is a crustal scale feature. On the NS profile the crust thins more gradually to 40 km thickness beneath Middle Atlas and 42 km beneath the Betics. These new seismic results are in overall agreement with regional trends of Bouguer gravity and are consistent with recent receiver function estimates of crustal thickness. The complex crustal structure of the Rif orogen in the Gibraltar Arc is a consequence of the Miocene collision between the Iberian and African plates. Both the abrupt change in crustal thickness at the Nekkor fault and the unexpectedly deep Rif crustal root can be attributed to interaction of the subducting Alboran slab with the North African passive margin at late Oligocene-early Miocene times.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>As several modeling studies indicate, the structural expression and dynamic behavior of orogenic mountain belts are dictated not only by their rheological properties or by far-field tectonic motion, but also by the efficiency of erosion and sedimentation acting on its surface. Until recently, numerical investigations have been mainly limited to 2-D studies because of the high computational cost required by 3-D models. Here, we have efficiently coupled the landscape evolution model Cascade with the 3-D thermomechanically coupled tectonics code FANTOM. Details of the coupling algorithms between both codes are given. We present results of numerical experiments designed to study the response of viscous-plastic crustal materials subjected to convergence and to surface processes including both erosion and sedimentation. In particular, we focus on the equilibration of both the tectonic structures and on the surface morphology of the orogen. We show that increasing the efficiency of fluvial erosion increases the frontal thrust angle, which in turn decreases the width of the orogen. In addition, the maximum summit elevation of the orogen during transient evolution is significantly higher in those models showcasing surface processes than those that do not. This illustrates the strong coupling between tectonics and surface processes. We also demonstrate that an along-strike gradient of erosion efficiency can have a major impact upon the landscape morphology and the tectonic structure and deformation of the orogen, in both the across-strike and along-strike directions. Overall, our results suggest that surface processes, by enhancing localization of deformation, can act as a positive forcing to topographic building.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Combined analyses of deep tow magnetic anomalies and International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 349 cores show that initial seafloor spreading started around 33 Ma in the northeastern South China Sea (SCS), but varied slightly by 1-2 Myr along the northern continent-ocean boundary (COB). A southward ridge jump of approximate to 20 km occurred around 23.6 Ma in the East Subbasin; this timing also slightly varied along the ridge and was coeval to the onset of seafloor spreading in the Southwest Subbasin, which propagated for about 400 km southwestward from approximate to 23.6 to approximate to 21.5 Ma. The terminal age of seafloor spreading is approximate to 15 Ma in the East Subbasin and approximate to 16 Ma in the Southwest Subbasin. The full spreading rate in the East Subbasin varied largely from approximate to 20 to approximate to 80 km/Myr, but mostly decreased with time except for the period between approximate to 26.0 Ma and the ridge jump (approximate to 23.6 Ma), within which the rate was the fastest at approximate to 70 km/Myr on average. The spreading rates are not correlated, in most cases, to magnetic anomaly amplitudes that reflect basement magnetization contrasts. Shipboard magnetic measurements reveal at least one magnetic reversal in the top 100 m of basaltic layers, in addition to large vertical intensity variations. These complexities are caused by late-stage lava flows that are magnetized in a different polarity from the primary basaltic layer emplaced during the main phase of crustal accretion. Deep tow magnetic modeling also reveals this smearing in basement magnetizations by incorporating a contamination coefficient of 0.5, which partly alleviates the problem of assuming a magnetic blocking model of constant thickness and uniform magnetization. The primary contribution to magnetic anomalies of the SCS is not in the top 100 m of the igneous basement.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Ona Basin is a small intra-oceanic basin located in the southwestern corner of the Scotia Sea. This region is crucial for an understanding of the early phases of opening of Drake Passage, since it may contain the oldest oceanic crust of the entire western Scotia Sea, where conflicting age differences from Eocene to Oligocene have been proposed to date. The precise timing of the gateway opening between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, moreover, has significant paleoceanographic and global implications. Two sub-basins are identified in this region, the eastern and western Ona basins, separated by the submarine relief of the Ona High. A dense geophysical data set collected during the last two decades is analyzed here. The data include multichannel seismic reflection profiles, and magnetic and gravimetric data.
   <br>The oceanic basement is highly deformed by normal, reverse and transcurrent faults, as well as affected by deep intrusions from the mantle. The initial extension and continental thinning, with subsequent oceanic spreading, were followed by compression and thrusting. Several elongated troughs, bounded by faults, depict a thick sequence of depositional units in the basin. Eight seismic units are identified in a deep trough of the eastern Ona Basin. The deposits reach a thickness of 5 km, a consistent value not previously reported from the Scotia Sea. A body of chaotic seismic fades is also observed above the thinned continental crust of the Ona High. Magnetic seafloor anomalies older than C10 (similar to 28.5 Ma) may be present in the region. The anomalies could include up to chron C12r (similar to 32 Ma), although their identification is difficult, since the amplitude is subdued and the original oceanic crust was highly deformed by later faulting and thrusting. The magnetic anomaly distribution is not congruent with seafloor spreading from a single ridge. The basin plain is tilted and subducted southwestward below the South Shetland Islands Block, particularly in the western part, where an accretionary prism is identified. Such tectonics, locally affecting up to the most recent deposits, imply that a portion of the primitive oceanic crust is absent. Based on the stratigraphy of the deposits and the magnetic anomalies, an age of 44 Ma is postulated for the initiation of oceanic spreading in the eastern Ona basin, while spreading in the western Ona Basin would have occurred during the early Oligocene.
   <br>The tectonics, depositional units and the age of the oceanic crust provide additional evidence regarding the Eocene opening of Drake Passage. The initial tectonic fragmentation of the South America-Antarctic Bridge, followed by oceanic spreading, was characterized by jumping of the spreading centers. An Eocene spreading center in the eastern Ona Basin was the precursor of the Scotia Sea. A model comprising four tectonic evolutionary phases is proposed: Phase I, Pacific subduction - Paleocene to middle Eocene; Phase II, eastern Ona back-arc spreading - middle to late Eocene; Phase III, ridge jumping and western Ona back-arc spreading - early Oligocene; and Phase IV, ridge jumping and West Scotia Ridge spreading - early Oligocene to late Miocene.
   <br>The development of shallow gateways allowed for an initial connection between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans and, hence, initiated the thermal isolation of Antarctica during the middle and late Eocene. Deep gateways that enhanced the full isolation of Antarctica developed in Drake Passage from the Eocene/Oligocene transition onward. A significant correlation is observed between the tectonics, stratigraphic units and major climate events, thereby indicating the influence of the local tectonic and paleoceanographic events of the Southern Ocean on global evolution.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The major structural and tectonic features of the Fuegian Andes provide an outstanding onshore geological framework that aids in the understanding of the tectonic evolution of the Scotia Arc, mainly known from offshore studies. The orogenic history of the Fuegian Andes (Late Cretaceous-Miocene) is thus compared and integrated with the tectonic history of the Scotia Sea. Late Cretaceous-Paleocene structures in the Fuegian Andes suggest a N-directed contraction consistent with an oroclinal bending of the southernmost South America-Antarctic Peninsula continental bridge. This N-directed contraction in the Fuegian Andes continued during the spreading of the West Scotia Ridge, between 40-50 and 10 Ma ago. The onset of major strike-slip faulting in Tierra del Fuego is considered here to be not older than the late Miocene, consistent with the recent history of the North Scotia Ridge; thus forming part of a tectonic regime superposed to the prior contraction in the Fuegian Andes.

The results include the interpretation of 20 deep seismic sounding profiles located along the western coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. Additionally, a few shallow seismic profiles in the Deception Island area and a total of 10 reflection profiles from the Bransfield Strait and Drake Passage area were carried out. Crustal velocity models extending across the Antarctic Peninsula continental shelf between the Adelaide Island and the Bransfield Strait show a typical continental crustal structure, with crustal thicknesses of 36-42 km near the coast that decreases to 25-28 km beneath the outer continental shelf. Farther north in the Bransfield Strait region, the models document a southeastward dip of the Moho discontinuity from a depth of 12 km beneath the South Shetland Trench to 40 km under the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. Beneath the trough of the Bransfield Strait, a high-velocity body with P-wave velocities exceeding 7.0 km/s was detected in a depth range of 6-32 km. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>A reappraisal of surface wave tomography in the remote Scotia Sea region and surrounding ridges is presented. New group velocity dispersion curves were obtained from local and regional earthquakes recorded at permanent Antarctic stations from 2001 to 2013 and used to update the measurements reported by Vuan et al. (2000). Rayleigh and Love group velocity maps for periods ranging from 15 to 50 s were retrieved using a tomographic inversion. The group velocity anomalies are clearly associated with the major crustal and upper mantle features of the Antarctic, Scotia and South American plates. The updated dataset allows for considerable decrease of the correlation length of the crustal heterogeneities that can be resolved, especially in the west Scotia Sea, central Scotia Sea and Bransfield Basin. Surface wave tomography results were compared with CRUST 1.0 group velocity maps and revealed specific areas where more detailed information is made available by our regional study. In particular, low group velocity anomalies of the Bransfield Strait rifting and continental fragments that are detached from the Antarctic Peninsula and spreading along the South Scotia ridge are not shown by the reference CRUST 1.0 model. A comparison between the average seismic velocities beneath the west and central Scotia Sea shows that both have an oceanic-type structure; however, the crust of the central sea is thicker (12-14 km) and slower than that of the 20 Ma old western sea.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Analysis of a new regional compilation of magnetic anomalies from marine, aeromagnetic and satellite data reveals the main structural/tectonic elements of the Scotia Arc. The most relevant magnetic anomaly in the continental crust, the Pacific Margin Anomaly (PMA), is related to composite magmatic arc batholiths. It was emplaced by subduction processes along the Pacific continental margin of the Antarctic Peninsula and can be followed within the continental blocks of the South Scotia Ridge and South America. Four representative magnetic profiles also show the structure in depth, and allow us to characterize the main crustal elements of the region. The new compilation and models improve our knowledge of the Scotia Arc's development. The PMA is seen to have a roughly W-E orientation, decreasing in intensity eastwards from the Pacific Margin of the Antarctic Peninsula, and extending towards the South Scotia Ridge to Discovery Bank and even to Herdman Bank. However, the identification of the PMA in the North Scotia Ridge is uncertain, since the magnetic anomalies and the modeled profiles do not support the presence of an important batholithic body. This setting can be attributed to the kinematics of subduction, almost orthogonal to the Pacific margin of the Antarctic Peninsula and oblique along the South American margin. Based on the new magnetic anomaly map, magnetic modeling, and the continuity of the PMA along the Antarctic Peninsula and South Scotia Ridge, we propose a reconstruction of the initial distribution of the main continental blocks in the initial stages during the Cretaceous. The anomalies identified in the northern Scotia Sea are probably related to local basic and/or intermediate igneous rocks intruded in pull-apart basins that developed in the South America-Antarctica plate boundary deformation zone during the initial stages of South Atlantic Ocean and Weddell Sea spreading.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The geological evolution of the Scotia Arc, which developed between Antarctica and South America, has facilitated the connection between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans and, has important global implications. To improve the knowledge of the late Mesozoic evolution of the southern Scotia Arc, over 6000 brittle mesostructures were measured over the last 20 years at different outcrops from the northern Antarctic Peninsula and the South Shetland Islands as well as the James Ross and South Orkney archipelagos. This dataset covers a length of more than 1000 km of the arc. Fault data were analysed using the Etchecopar, y-R, Right Dihedra, Stress Inversion and Search Grid Inversion Palaeostress Determination methods. A total of 275 stress tensors were obtained. The results showed that the maximum horizontal stress was in the ENE-WSW and the NW-SE orientations and that the horizontal extension tensors were oriented NE-SW and NW-SE. In addition, seismic activity and focal mechanism solutions were analysed using the Gephart method to establish the present-day stress field and characterise the active tectonics. The results obtained suggest that there is a regional NE-SW compression and a NW-SE extension regime at the present day. The Southern Scotia Arc has a complex geological history due to the different tectonic settings (transform, convergent and divergent) that have affected this sector during its geological evolution from the late Mesozoic until the present day. Six stress fields were obtained from the brittle mesostructure population analysis in the region. The NW-SE and N-S maximum horizontal stresses were related to a combination of Mesozoic oceanic subduction of the former Phoenix Plate under the Pacific margin of the Antarctic Plate, Mesozoic-Cenozoic subduction of the northern Weddell Sea and the Oligocene to the Middle Miocene dextral strike-slip movement between the Scotia and Antarctic plates along the South Scotia Ridge. The NE-SW compression was related to late Miocene to present-day sinistral transcurrent movement along the South Scotia Ridge. Finally, the NW-SE extensional stress field may be related to the development of the following back-arc basins: the Late Cretaceous-Eocene Larsen Basin, the Lower to Middle Miocene Jane Basin and the Pliocene to present-day Bransfield Basin. In addition, the NE-SW and the E-W tensional stress fields were related to the Oligocene opening of the Powell Basin. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The N-S trending Scan Basin is the easternmost deep basin north of the South Scotia Ridge, which is a geologically complex structural elevation that hosts the strike-slip boundary between the Scotia and Antarctic plates. We characterized the main morpho-structural features of the basin by analyzing the available multichannel seismic reflection profiles. The reconstruction of the seismo-stratigraphy reveals the growth patterns of the Scan Basin. Seismic data and gravity modeling support the interpretation that the basin is mainly floored by oceanic crust, however its northern and southern provinces exhibit different seismic attributes. Stratigraphic calibrations with adjacent regions together with the distribution of sedimentary units indicate that this basin was formed by rifting processes and subsequent spreading accretion from the Oligocene to the Miocene. This age attribution suggests that the Scan Basin might be one of the oldest oceanic basins of the southern Scotia Sea possibly coeval with the Eocene-Oligocene opening of the Drake Passage. The basin is the most direct connection between the Weddell Sea and the Scotia Sea, whereas the stratigraphic features reveal the occurrence of major paleoceanographic changes. The initial phases of the evolution were influenced by mass-transport and turbidite processes of sediment supply from the nearby continental margins of the eastern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. From the Middle Miocene to the Present-day, the eastward motion of the basin due to plate tectonic and the connection with the Weddell Sea through gateways enabled instauration of the overflow of Weddell Sea Deep Water (WSDW) into the Scan Basin. The WSDW forced the northward migration of the Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) and became progressively dominant controlling depositional patterns. The results that we report here should prove essential for understanding the formation of the Scotia Sea, the beginning of the Scotia Arc fragmentation, and the increasing role played by Weddell Sea/Scotia Sea water-mass exchange.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The biogeographic hypothesis more accepted today is that Antarctica (West Antarctica) and southern South America (Magellan region, Patagonia) were connected by a long and narrow causeway (Weddellian Isthmus) between the Antarctic Peninsula and South America since the Late Cretaceous (Campanian) until the Early Paleogene allowing terrestrial vertebrates to colonize new frontiers using this land bridge. Stratigraphically calibrated phylogenies including large, terrestrial native ungulates Litopterna and Astrapotheria taxa reveal long ghost lineages that extended into the Late Paleocene and provide evidence for the minimum times at which these "native ungulates" were present both on Antarctica and South America. Based on these results we estimate that the Weddellian Isthmus was functional as a land bridge until the Late Paleocene. Our data place the disconnection between Antarctica and South America in the Late Paleocene, indicating that the terrestrial faunistic isolation (Simpson's "splendid isolation") in South America begun at the end of the Paleocene (similar to 56 to 57 m.y.). This faunistic isolation is documented to have occurred at least 25 Ma before the existence of deep-water circulation conditions in Drake Passage (similar to 30 m.y.) based on the onset of seafloor spreading in the west Scotia Sea region. We hypothesize that in the early stages of extension (Late Paleocene, similar to 55 m.y.) a wide and relatively shallow epicontinental sea developed between the Antarctic Peninsula and South America drowning the Weddellian Isthmus and preventing the faunal interchange for obligate cursorial terrestrial forms.

They are believed to form via small-scale mantle upwellings, lithospheric instability, or a combination thereof. Coronae and rifts commonly occur together, including many coronae that lie outside of the fracture zone. However, the genetic link between the two has remained unclear. This paper proposes a mechanism for the formation of off-rift coronae due to the rifting process. We model the interaction of a rising mantle plume associated with a rift with a hypothetical preexisting layer of dense material in the lithosphere. We show that a rift and its associated off-rift coronae could be genetically linked by the process of development of secondary ringlike dripping instabilities initiating at the plume margins. We calculate the resulting surface topographies, melt volumes, and Bouguer gravity anomalies and compare them to observations.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>How continental lithosphere responds to tectonic stresses and mantle convective processes is determined in large part by its mechanical strength and temperature distribution, which depend on crustal heat production. In order to establish reliable crustal and thermal models for the Superior Craton, Canadian Shield, new measurements of heat flux and heat production in 28 deep boreholes at 16 sites are combined with a larger set of older data. The Superior Province was assembled by the docking of volcanic/plutonic and metasedimentary terranes and continental fragments to the southern margin of an older core around 2.7Ga. The average heat flux is much lower in the craton core than in the accreted terranes, 31 versus 43mWm(-2). The major accreted volcanic/plutonic belts share the same heat production characteristics, testifying to the remarkable uniformity of crust-building mechanisms. The marked difference between the crusts of the core and the accreted belts supports the operation of two different crust-forming processes. The crust of the craton core has an enriched upper layer, in contrast to that of the younger belts which lack marked internal differentiation. At the end of amalgamation, the lithosphere of the craton core was colder and mechanically stronger than the lithosphere beneath newly accreted material. Surrounding the craton core with weaker belts may have ensured its stability against tectonic and mantle convection perturbations. This large strength contrast accounts for the lack of lithospheric imbrication at the edge of the craton core as well as for the different characteristics of seismic anisotropy in the lithospheres of the craton core and the younger terranes.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The northern Gulf of Elat/Aqaba is located in the transition between the deep marine basins of the gulf and the shallow onland basins of the Arava Valley. Interpretation of 500km of high-resolution seismic reflection data collected across the northern shelf reveals the tectonic structure and evolution of this transition. Six NNE-trending faults and one E-W trending transverse fault are mapped. Slip rates are calculated based on measured offsets and age determination based on a radiocarbon-calibrated sedimentation rate and a Quaternary age model. The most active fault is the Evrona Fault that absorbs most of the left lateral slip within the basin with an average sinistral slip rate of 0.70.3mm/yr through the Late Pleistocene and 2.3-3.4mm/yr during the Holocene. Two intrabasin faults east of the Evrona Fault that have been inactive for the last several tens of thousands of years were mapped, and motion from these faults has likely transferred to the Evrona Fault. The basin is flanked on the west by the Elat Fault and on the east by the Aqaba Fault. Both faults are marked by large bathymetric escarpments. Based on displaced seismic reflectors, we calculate a Holocene vertical slip rate of 1.00.2 and 0.40.1mm/yr for the Elat and Aqaba Faults, respectively. The geometry, slip rates, and slip history of the northern Gulf of Elat/Aqaba faults show that during the Late Pleistocene several intrabasin faults became dominant across the basin but that during the Holocene the Evrona Fault accommodates most of the strike slip.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Based on structural and fabric analyses at variable scales we investigate the evaporitic gypsumdominated Comeglians-Paularo shear zone in the Southern Alps (Friuli). It represents the lateral western termination of the brittle Fella-Sava Fault. Missing dehydration products of gypsum and the lack of annealing indicate temperatures below 100 degrees C during development of the shear zone. Despite of such low temperatures the shear zone clearly exhibits mylonitic flow, thus evidencing laterally coeval activity of brittle and viscous deformation.
   <br>The dominant structures within the gypsum rocks of the Lower Bellerophon Formation are a steeply to gently S-dipping foliation, a subhorizontal stretching lineation and pure shear-dominated porphyroclast systems. A subordinate simple shear component with dextral displacement is indicated by scattered sigma-clasts. Both mesa- and microscale structures are characteristic of a subsimple shear type of deformation with components of both coaxial and non-coaxial strain. Shortening in a transpressive regime was accommodated by right-lateral displacement and internal pure shear deformation within the Comeglians-Paularo shear zone. The shear zone shows evidence for a combination of two stretching faults, where stretching occurred in the rheologically weaker gypsum member and brittle behavior in enveloping lithologies.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The intensity and tectonic origin of late Cenozoic intraplate deformation in eastern Australia is relatively poorly understood. Here we show that Cenozoic volcanic rocks in southeast Queensland have been deformed by numerous faults. Using gridded aeromagnetic data and field observations, structural investigations were conducted on these faults. Results show that faults have mainly undergone strike-slip movement with a reverse component, displacing Cenozoic volcanic rocks ranging in ages from similar to 31 to similar to 21 Ma. These ages imply that faulting must have occurred after the late Oligocene. Late Cenozoic deformation has mostly occurred due to the reactivation of major faults, which were active during episodes of basin formation in the Jurassic-Early Cretaceous and later during the opening of the Tasman and Coral Seas from the Late Cretaceous to the early Eocene. The wrench reactivation of major faults in the late Cenozoic also gave rise to the occurrence of brittle subsidiary reverse strike-slip faults that affected Cenozoic volcanic rocks. Intraplate transpressional deformation possibly resulted from far-field stresses transmitted from the collisional zones at the northeast and southeast boundaries of the Australian plate during the late Oligocene-early Miocene and from the late Miocene to the Pliocene. These events have resulted in the hitherto unrecognized reactivation of faults in eastern Australia. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>New structural, geometric, petrographic, and U-Pb zircon data constrain the kinematics of the Xuelongshan high strain zone, northermost parts of the Ailao Shan-Red River shear zone. In the Xuelongshan range, mylonitic foliation mainly trends NW-SE. On steep foliation and flatted foliation, mineral stretching lineation is various, from gentle to steep, and ductile shear senses indicate a left-lateral, top-to-the-northwest shear movement on the eastern limb, and a left lateral, top-to-the-southeast shear on the western limb of the range. These dome-related ductile geometries and kinematics, namely D1 deformation, represent regional high-temperature metamorphism due to crustal thickening. The superimposed sinistral strike-slip shearing of D2 deformation occurred locally along the earlier domal fabrics. Metamorphism, migmatization, and the emplacement of leucogranitic veins associated with partial melting were syntectonic with the regional-scale upright antiform. LA-ICP-MS U-Pb dating of zircons reveals the late Permian-Triassic and Oligocene thermal events. The latter event (ca. 33-26 Ma or possibly earlier) from the leucogranitic veins corresponds to the regional metamorphism during crustal thickening along the Xuelongshan. These data indicate that the Jiali-Xuelongshan-Diancangshan-Ailao Shan high strain zones can belong to a system around the Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis (EHS), and that the Xuelongshan zone played a role in linking other segments between the Tibet to Indochina in Cenozoic.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>We quantify the evolution of thrust-ramp anticlines exhibiting growth and/or erosion using the area-depth-strain (ADS) method. We illustrate, validate, and explore the limitations of the ADS method for a series of kinematic models and experimental sand (analog) models. We then apply the method to a seismically imaged thrust-ramp anticline from the deep-water Niger Delta. The ADS method allows determination of the boundary displacements, displacement rates, and layer-parallel strains using the excess areas (areas of marker beds above their regional level) of multiple horizons. The kinematic and experimental models demonstrate that excess areas for pre-deformation units lie on a straight line on an area depth graph, the inverse slope of which is the boundary displacement and the intercept is the elevation of the basal detachment. For growth strata, the line connecting an area-depth value to the value representing the basal detachment gives the displacement after deposition of that horizon. For partially eroded markers, the calculated displacements are less than the actual displacements; however, originally planar unconformities yield the displacements that accrued after the formation of the unconformities. The experimental sand models show substantial layer-parallel shortening in the anticlines, displacements on the main thrust ramp that are only half the displacement on the basal detachment, and small tectonic dilations. The seismic example is an area-balanced ramp anticline with clearly defined pre-deformation and growth sequences. Fault separation at the center of the ramp in the pre-deformation interval is approximately equal to the total boundary displacement but decreases both upward and downward. The layer-parallel strains have the opposite pattern, with the lowest values at the center of the ramp and increasing values both upward and downward. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Tulungwan-Chaochou Fault system in southern Taiwan represents the boundary between a slate belt of moderate metamorphic grade and a relatively unmetamorphosed fold-and-thrust belt. The offset between hanging wall and footwall of this fault ranges from 7 to 11 km and is considered one of the major tectonostratigraphic faults in Taiwan. This 75-km-long fault system is also one of the most conspicuous topographic features in Taiwan. The geometry, kinematic history and associated subsidiary structures have not been resolved. Field mapping of fabrics and brittle faults show that a 45-km-long west-northwest-vergent antiform defined by folded slaty cleavage exists in the hanging wall of the fault. This antiform has not been previously described and apparently formed in a brittle environment. The flat crest and tight forelimb of the antiform suggests a two-stage deformation model composed of a fault-bend fold followed by a trishear fold. We infer that regional scale fold is associated with a thrust that splays upward from the main detachment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Zircon grains in granites from Avalonian and Ganderian rocks in southern New England host brittle internal structures that are interpreted here to show the host rocks to be allochthonous. Significant among these structures are inherited cores that are commonly fractured and even dismembered. This intense fracturing is interpreted as reflecting an important cataclastic event. The maximum age of fracturing is constrained to be younger than the age of the youngest broken magmatic core: 360 +/- 4 Ma. The minimum age must be older than the oldest zircon rim that heals these fractures: that is, Early Permian. The occurrence of cataclastic zircon requires that these rocks were relatively cold (i.e. in the upper crust) during the Carboniferous and therefore were not involved in the pervasive high-grade Acadian metamorphism. The present map pattern of inter-tonguing high-grade and low-grade slices of peri-Gondwanan rocks shows that they were assembled by crustal-scale tectonic wedging. The consequent thickening ultimately led to anatexis in the lower slices during the Permian. Thus, evidence for cataclasis of zircon grains from the Avalon and Gander terranes of southern New England suggests that these peri-Gondwanan terranes remained outboard of Laurentia during the well-documented Early Devonian Acadian orogeny and were first fully accreted to North America during the Alleghanian (Permian) orogeny.
