<td valign="top">AB </td><td>We quantify the evolution of thrust-ramp anticlines exhibiting growth and/or erosion using the area-depth-strain (ADS) method. We illustrate, validate, and explore the limitations of the ADS method for a series of kinematic models and experimental sand (analog) models. We then apply the method to a seismically imaged thrust-ramp anticline from the deep-water Niger Delta. The ADS method allows determination of the boundary displacements, displacement rates, and layer-parallel strains using the excess areas (areas of marker beds above their regional level) of multiple horizons. The kinematic and experimental models demonstrate that excess areas for pre-deformation units lie on a straight line on an area depth graph, the inverse slope of which is the boundary displacement and the intercept is the elevation of the basal detachment. For growth strata, the line connecting an area-depth value to the value representing the basal detachment gives the displacement after deposition of that horizon. For partially eroded markers, the calculated displacements are less than the actual displacements; however, originally planar unconformities yield the displacements that accrued after the formation of the unconformities. The experimental sand models show substantial layer-parallel shortening in the anticlines, displacements on the main thrust ramp that are only half the displacement on the basal detachment, and small tectonic dilations. The seismic example is an area-balanced ramp anticline with clearly defined pre-deformation and growth sequences. Fault separation at the center of the ramp in the pre-deformation interval is approximately equal to the total boundary displacement but decreases both upward and downward. The layer-parallel strains have the opposite pattern, with the lowest values at the center of the ramp and increasing values both upward and downward. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Tulungwan-Chaochou Fault system in southern Taiwan represents the boundary between a slate belt of moderate metamorphic grade and a relatively unmetamorphosed fold-and-thrust belt. The offset between hanging wall and footwall of this fault ranges from 7 to 11 km and is considered one of the major tectonostratigraphic faults in Taiwan. This 75-km-long fault system is also one of the most conspicuous topographic features in Taiwan. The geometry, kinematic history and associated subsidiary structures have not been resolved. Field mapping of fabrics and brittle faults show that a 45-km-long west-northwest-vergent antiform defined by folded slaty cleavage exists in the hanging wall of the fault. This antiform has not been previously described and apparently formed in a brittle environment. The flat crest and tight forelimb of the antiform suggests a two-stage deformation model composed of a fault-bend fold followed by a trishear fold. We infer that regional scale fold is associated with a thrust that splays upward from the main detachment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Zircon grains in granites from Avalonian and Ganderian rocks in southern New England host brittle internal structures that are interpreted here to show the host rocks to be allochthonous. Significant among these structures are inherited cores that are commonly fractured and even dismembered. This intense fracturing is interpreted as reflecting an important cataclastic event. The maximum age of fracturing is constrained to be younger than the age of the youngest broken magmatic core: 360 +/- 4 Ma. The minimum age must be older than the oldest zircon rim that heals these fractures: that is, Early Permian. The occurrence of cataclastic zircon requires that these rocks were relatively cold (i.e. in the upper crust) during the Carboniferous and therefore were not involved in the pervasive high-grade Acadian metamorphism. The present map pattern of inter-tonguing high-grade and low-grade slices of peri-Gondwanan rocks shows that they were assembled by crustal-scale tectonic wedging. The consequent thickening ultimately led to anatexis in the lower slices during the Permian. Thus, evidence for cataclasis of zircon grains from the Avalon and Gander terranes of southern New England suggests that these peri-Gondwanan terranes remained outboard of Laurentia during the well-documented Early Devonian Acadian orogeny and were first fully accreted to North America during the Alleghanian (Permian) orogeny.
